Melanosome movement represents a good model of cytoskeleton-mediated transport of organelles in eukaryotic cells. We recently observed that inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with Nv-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) induced dispersion in melanophores pre-aggregated with melatonin. Activation of cyclic adenosine 3%,5%-monophosphate (cAMP)dependent protein kinase (PKA) or calcium-dependent protein kinase (PKC) is known to cause dispersion. Also, PKC and NO have been shown to regulate the mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway. Accordingly, our objective was to further characterize the signaling pathway of L-NAME-induced dispersion. We found that the dispersion was decreased by staurosporine and PD98059, which respectively inhibit PKC and MEK, but not by the PKA

inhibitor H89. Furthermore, Western blotting revealed that ERK1 kinase was phosphorylated in L-NAME-dispersed melanophores. L-NAME also caused dispersion in latrunculin-B-treated cells, suggesting that this effect is not due to inhibition of the melatonin signaling pathway. Summarizing, we observed that PKC and MEK inhibitors decreased the L-NAME-induced dispersion, which caused phosphorylation of ERK1. Our results also suggest that NO is a negative regulator of phosphorylations that leads to organelle transport.

INTRODUCTION
Directed cytoskeleton-mediated transport of organelles and vesicles in eukaryotic cells is essential for a variety of cellular processes, such as mitosis, secretion, axonal transport, endocytosis, and intercompartmental trafﬁcking (1, 2). Moreover, nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to affect cellular functions that depend on cytoskeletal proteins, for example, aggregation of neutrophils (3) and endothelial permeability (4). These ﬁndings prompted our interest in the possible effects of NO signaling on intracellular transloca-

tion of pigment organelles (melanosomes) in Xenopus lae6is melanophores. Melanophores, containing dark melanin pigment granules, constitute one important class of chromatophores, responsible for spectacular color changes of ﬁshes, frogs, and other lower vertebrates due to the motile activities of specialized pigment-containing cells. The pigment granules may be stimulated to undergo rapid dispersion throughout the cell (cells appear dark) or aggregation to the center of the cell (cells appear light). We recently found that

inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in melanophores by exposing the cells to Nv-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (LNAME) decreased melatonin-induced aggregation and caused melanosomes to disperse (5).
Aggregation of pigment organelles in amphibians can be induced by melatonin, which binds to its membrane receptor and thereby causes a decrease in intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3%,5%-monophosphate) levels (6) through interaction with an inhibitory G-protein (7, 8). Aggregation can also be achieved using latrunculin to inhibit polymerization of actin (9). How inhibition of actin polymerization causes pigment aggregation is not clear. Pigment dispersion can be stimulated by a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH), which increases cAMP levels (10). Several studies have shown that both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) are involved in pigment dispersion [(11– 13); see (14) for a review of signal transduction in pigment cells]. According to the working model of pigment organelle transport [for review see (15)], during aggregation in amphibian melanophores, the melanosomes are moved along microtubules by the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein. During dispersion, these organelles are carried along microtubules by the motor protein kinesin II for long-range transport, and then evenly distributed by short-range movement along actin ﬁlaments driven by the actin motor myosin V. In a recent study, Reese and Haimo (16) showed that the direction of movement is regulated by phosphorylations of the motor proteins, which alter the binding of these proteins to microtubules.
NO is a reactive compound with a multitude of diverse functions, and it is produced by several different types of cells. It is synthesized from L-arginine by a family of NOSs. Signal transduction by NO can be mediated through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), leading to increased production of cGMP (17) and activation of cGMP-dependent kinases (PKGs); cGMP-independent mechanisms have also been described (29). A target of one PKG is phospholipase C (PLC), which is inhibited by interaction with this kinase (18). This results in decreased levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and intracellular Ca2+, which may negatively regulate the activation of PKC. Conversely, it is possible that deﬁciency of NO does not activate PKG, hence PKC may remain in an active state and cause melanosome dispersion.
Olsen and coworkers have found that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1 copuriﬁes with tubulin (19), and that inhibiting the activity of MAPKs can alter the structure of the cytoskeleton and cell morphology by stabilizing microtubules (19). Endogenously synthesized NO has been shown to suppress the MAPK cascade and thereby inhibit cellular proliferation (20). Thus, inhibition of NO synthesis may exert effects on the cytoskeleton-dependent transport of pigment organelles by activating mitogen/extracellular-activated kinase (MEK). We have previously shown that inhibition of NOS in melatonin-pre-aggregated melanophores leads to dispersion of melanosomes (5). Therefore, the objective of the present study was to further characterize the signaling pathway of L-NAME-induced dispersion and to determine whether this effect is caused by interference with melatonin-receptor signaling and involves activation of kinases such as PKC, PKA, or MEK.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
Xenopus lae6is ﬁbroblasts and melanophores were generously provided by Dr. Michael Lerner (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The ﬁbroblasts were cultured at 27°C in ambient air, in 70% Leibovitz L-15 medium consisting of ﬁve parts Leibovitz L-15, three parts sterile water, two parts heat-inactivated (56°C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The melanophores were cultured in the same way but in Leibovitz L-15 medium that had been conditioned by the ﬁbroblasts for 3–4 days and then collected using a 0.22-mM bottle-top ﬁlter. All cell culture reagents and ﬁlters were obtained from Life Technologies (Ta¨by, Sweden); cell culture plasticware was purchased from Sarstedt (Landskrona, Sweden).
Microtiter Plate Assay
The microtiter plate dispersion assay was modiﬁed from previously described protocols (21). For this procedure, 2 × 104 melanophores were seeded in each well of ﬂat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates (Sarstedt) and grown at 27°C to conﬂuence (2–3 days). Immediately before an experiment, the cells were washed with 70% L-15 medium without supplements, which was also used to dilute the drugs tested.
To test various drugs regarding their ability to inhibit L-NAME-induced dispersion, the melanophores were ﬁrst pre-treated with 50 ml of either 10 nM melatonin or 5 mM latrunculin B for 30 min to 1 hr to induce aggregation. Thereafter, the drugs of interest were added (at twice the ﬁnal working concentration in 50 ml of 70% L-15 containing 10 nM melatonin or 5 mM latrunculin B), and the cells were incubated for 10 min, and initial absorbance (Ai) was then measured at 650 nm using a Vmax™ kinetic microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Go¨ teborgs termometerfabrik, Go¨ teborg, Sweden). Thereafter, L-NAME was added (at three times the working concentration in 50 ml of L-15 containing 10 nM melatonin or 5 mM latrunculin B) together with the drug to be tested (at once the working concentration). The cells were then incubated for 30 min before measuring the ﬁnal absorbance (Af).
The following reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB: the NO synthesis substrate L-arginine, the NO synthesis inhibitor L-NAME, the inactive L-NAME stereoisomer D-NAME (Nv-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester), and the melanosome aggregator melatonin.
Other reagents were purchased from Calbiochem, LabKemi (Stockholm, Sweden): PD98059, which inhibits MEK (also called MAPKK); the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin B; the PKA inhibitor H89; the PKC inhibitor staurosporine; PP2, which inhibits the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases; and the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin.
The change in pigment dispersion was quantiﬁed on the basis of initial absorbance (Ai) and absorbance after 30 min (Af), using the equation Af/Ai − 1. A value of zero indicates no aggregation or dispersion of melanosomes, a negative
451

value stands for aggregation, and a positive value indicates dispersion as compared with the initial state of the melanophore. In the experiments on the effects of various inhibitors on L-NAME-induced dispersion, the measurement data from different treatments were normalized against the dispersion induced by L-NAME alone. A negative value indicates that aggregation did occur. With few exceptions, each sample was run in duplicate, and measurements were repeated 3 –6 times; n denotes the number of wells measured for each treatment.
Measurement of Intracellular cAMP
Intracellular cAMP levels were measured 5 min after treatment of the melanophores with L-arginine or L-NAME. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and the samples were kept at − 70°C pending homogenization, which was done in ice-cold 5% TCA. The resulting suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000g, and the supernatants were extracted with water-saturated diethyl ether, and the water phase was lyophilized and then dissolved in sodium acetate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.2). The cAMP content was measured with the radioimmunoassay (RIA) described in (22), using [125I]-cAMP as a labeled substance and antibodies that were prepared in our laboratory. Each sample was run in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated six times.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether the kinases ERK1/ERK2 (p44/p42MAPK), which are located downstream of MEK, were phosphorylated in the presence of L-NAME. Conﬂuent melanophores in 25-cm2 culture ﬂasks were rinsed with 70% L-15 medium without FBS and then pre-aggregated with 1 nM melatonin for 1 hr. Thereafter, the cells were treated with 1 mM L-NAME or L-arginine in medium containing 1 nM melatonin, or they were incubated in medium supplemented only with 1 nM melatonin. The melanophores were then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; tablets, 70% solution in sterile water; Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB) and put on ice to stop the reaction at the indicated times. The cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N%,N%-tetraacetic acid [EGTA], 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride [PMSF], 20 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin, 1% v/v Triton X-100, and 0.1% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) pH 7.4) and scraped off the bottoms of the culture ﬂasks with a rubber policeman. The suspensions were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, which were placed on an orbital shaker for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting cell lysates were centrifuged at 5,000g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE (10 mg/ lane) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA; Boeringer Mannheim, Stockholm, Sweden) in washing buffer (0.075% v/v Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated for 1 hr with primary antibodies, speciﬁcally anti-human MAP ki-
452

nase ERK1/ERK2-phospho-speciﬁc antibodies (442705; Calbiochem) diluted 1:2,000 in washing buffer containing 3% BSA. The membrane was subsequently incubated for 1 hr with the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (DAKO A/S, (Stockholm, Sweden), diluted 1:4,000 with washing buffer containing 3% BSA. The membranes were analyzed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Statistical Analysis Wilcoxon’s matched pair signed rank test was used for the statistical analysis and a P-valueB 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
RESULTS To ascertain whether L-NAME causes melanosome dispersion by antagonizing the aggregation-inducing signaling pathway of the melatonin receptor, melanosomes were preaggregated by disrupting the actin ﬁlaments with 5 mM latrunculin B, instead of by activating the melatonin receptor. Subsequent treatment with 1 mM L-NAME did induce dispersion (Fig. 1), which suggests that L-NAME induces dispersion in a more general manner. We used an RIA to determine whether L-NAME-induced dispersion increased levels of cAMP in the melanophores. Intracellular cAMP was not increased in cells treated with 1 mM L-NAME (1.7 9 0.6 pmol/well) compared with L-arginine (2.2 9 0.8 pmol/well). To further examine possible activations of PKA, PKC, and MEK (MAPKK) during pigment dispersion, we tested the inhibitors H89 (100 mM), staurosporine (31.6 mM), and PD98059 (10 nM) regarding their ability to decrease L-NAME-induced dispersion. Both staurosporine and PD98059 decreased the dispersion, whereas H89 did not (Fig. 2), which indicates activation of PKC and MEK but not PKA. Pigment dispersion was not reduced when the melanophores were treated with PP2, an inhibitor of Src kinases, or with the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3). The two MAPKs ERK1/ERK2 are located downstream of and are activated by MEK; thus, the next step was to ﬁnd out whether these MAPKs are phosphorylated during L-

NAME-induced dispersion. Western blots with antibodies against the phosphorylated form of ERK1/ERK2 revealed one band at 44 kDa, indicating that ERK1 was indeed activated by L-NAME but not by L-arginine (Fig. 4). These results imply that NO plays a role as a negative regulator of phosphorylation and activation in this system.
DISCUSSION Our results show that dispersion induced by L-NAME cannot be explained by interference with the melatonin signaling pathway, because dispersion also occurred in cells pre-aggregated with latrunculin B (Fig. 1). L-NAME did not increase intracellular cAMP concentrations, and the dispersion was not associated with PKA activity (Fig. 2). Instead we found that the staurosporine decreased L-NAME-induced dispersion, suggesting that PKC might be involved

Transferred membranes were probed with an antibody to Tyr204phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2. The blot shows one band at 44 kDa in L-NAME-treated but not in L-arginine-treated cells. The result implies that L-NAME-induced dispersion involves activation of ERK1.
(Fig. 2). The pleiotropic effects often seen with kinase inhibitors, such as staurosporine, can make it difﬁcult to draw deﬁnitive conclusions about the involvement of speciﬁc kinases. The kinases responsible for regulation of pigment dispersion in frog melanophores are PKA and PKC (11, 13). However, H89, which inhibits PKA, does not have any effect, even when used at very high concentration (100 mM; Fig. 2), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of staurosporine is not due to inhibition of PKA. Neither PKG nor CAMKII, two other known substrates for staurosporine, seems to be important in regulation of pigment movement in frog melanophores as has been shown in other studies (5, 13), supporting our initial hypothesis that inhibitory effect of staurosporine might be mediated by PKC. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 also decreased L-NAME-induced dispersion (Fig. 2). The signaling pathway leading to dispersion is also responsible for phosphorylation of ERK1 (Fig. 4), but it does not require PI3K or Src kinases (Fig. 3).
A great deal of attention has recently been focused on the question of how the direction of organelle transport along microtubules is regulated. It has been shown that the three motor proteins that drive the translocation in Xenopus lae6is melanophores, namely kinesin II, dynein, and myosin V, are attached to and co-purify with the melanosome (9, 23). Moreover, a recent study clearly demonstrated that the direction of the transport depends on phosphorylations of the speciﬁc motors, which affect the ability of these proteins to bind to microtubules (16). Reese and Haimo (16) also found that dynactin, which is somehow required for dyneinmediated transport of organelles, is inactivated by phosphorylation by PKC. Inasmuch as activation of PKC has been shown to induce partial dispersion (11–13), Reese and
453

Haimo reasoned that dynactin keeps organelles tethered at the minus end of the microtubules, thus inactivation of dynactin would cause dispersion of pigment organelles. As an alternative, these authors suggested that a minor pool of active kinesin II gives rise to the dispersion when dynactin is inactivated. In light of our results showing that inactivation of NOS causes dispersion and activates PKC and MEK, it is possible that dynactin is inactivated directly by PKC or indirectly through PKC-induced activation of MEK. In the presence of NO, dynactin would be active and be able to keep the pigment organelles in place. Another conceivable explanation is that phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) by active MEK, as shown by Shaw et al. (24), destabilizes the microtubules (25). Perhaps phosphorylations of MAPs induce changes in the microtubules or the attachment of motors, resulting in dispersion. Active MEK has, in fact, been shown to associate with in vivo and to phosphorylate in vitro the kinesin-related motor protein CENP-E, which is involved in the attachment of chromosomes to microtubules during mitosis (26).
This implies that NO is a negative regulator of PKC, which has been shown to activate the downstream MEKERK pathway through Raf in both COS (27) and PC12-E2 (28) cells. NO has also been reported to inhibit cellular proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells by both a cGMP-dependent and a cGMP-independent mechanism (29), and in a human embryonic kidney cell line by suppressing the MAPK cascade (20). NO has in fact been shown to inactivate PKC in several ways. For instance, A, kesson and Lundqvist (30) noted that L-NAME markedly potentiated the release of insulin from pancreatic islets that was induced by a phospholipase C (PLC) or a PKC activator. Furthermore, these investigators found that the release of insulin was inhibited by an NO donor without any effects on the IP3-Ca2+ messenger system, hence they suggested that NO inhibits PKC directly, perhaps through S-nitrosylation of critical thiol residues. NO has also been shown to inactivate PLC (18) by increasing intracellular cGMP levels, which activates PKG, which in turn interacts with and inactivates PLC. This inactivation of PLC decreases Ca2+ levels and probably inactivates PKC. Conversely, introducing L-NAME would lower cGMP levels, which would reduce activation of PKG and therefore not lead to inactivation of PLC; thus PKC might remain active and cause pigment dispersion. However, the latter pathway seems to be less likely, because, in a previous investigation (5), we were unable to induce melanosome dispersion with a PKG inhibitor, and have achieved only weak dispersion (compared with the effect of L-NAME) by treating melanophores with a guanylate cyclase inhibitor.
In conclusion, we found that inhibition of NO synthesis in melanophores causes pigment dispersion, which seems to involve activation of PKC, MEK, and ERK1, but is not dependent on melatonin receptor signaling. Our observations indicate a role for NO as a negative regulator of phosphorylations that lead to organelle transport. Perhaps melanosome dispersion is due to inactivation of dynactin by PKC. Alternatively, dispersion may be induced by alterations of the structure of microtubules or the binding of motor proteins as a result of phosphorylation of these
454

proteins directly or microtubule-associated proteins, by
PKC or kinases in the MEK-ERK cascade. Further studies
are needed to clarify this matter.
