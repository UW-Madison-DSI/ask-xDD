ABSTRACT
In a &-monfh,randomized, double-blind study the efects
of two conibined oral contraceptives containing 150 pg desoptrel and either 20 or 30 pg ethinylestradiol on
henzostatic parameters were investigated in 1633 healthy women. Compared with baseline, the 30 pg ethinylestradiol jiwnulatiori increased prothrombin fragment
c1 + 2 (+72.2%),D-dimer (+42.4%) and protein
activity (+6 . 1%), whereas antithrombin-Ill activity (-6.3%) and protein S activity (-19.7%) were decreased. The im Ofthe 20 pg ethinylestradiolforntulation was associated with the same pattern of changes, h i t with lower niagnitride (F1+2 +61. I % , D-dimer +36.0%, aritithronibin I l l -5.3%, protein C +4.6% and yroteiii S - 1 6.0%). T h e changesfrom baseline were sigrrijkaiitly smaller in the 20 pg ethinylestradiol group f o r n-dinier, antithrombin 111and protein S than in the
30 &Jefhinylestradiol group (p = 0.019, p = 0.038
and p = 0.001, resyectively). O n e woman with a combined deficiency of proteins C and S developed deep

venous thrombosis while using the 20 pg ethinylestradiol forniulation. Useofbothformulations was associated with a sh$ of the coagulation-J;brinolysis balance to an enhancedfibrin-generating and fibrin-degradating activity. T h e less-pronounced efect on hemostasis with the 20 pg ethinylestradiol preparation is reassuring with regard to thromboembolic risk in general. However, women with coagtrlation inhibitor deficiency should be advised not to use oral contraceptives.
INTRODUCTION
A major concern with the use oforal contraceptives is the increased risk of venous thrombosis and embolism'.'. Numerous studies have demonstrated that combined oral contraceptives induce changes in the hemostatic system. However, reviewing the older data, it was found that no single factor could be identified to assess the thrombogenicity of a

investigators and were supervised by an independent monitor. A total of 2674 volunteers were recruited and baseline analysis of the hemostatic variables was performed. Subjects were subsequcntly randomly assigned, in a one-to-three ratio,
to receive either 30 p g ethinylestradiol plus 150 pg desogestrel or 20 pg ethinylestradiol plus 150 pg
desogestrel. Participants commenced taking the trial preparations on the first day of menstruation and followed the usual regimen for oral contraceptives (21 pill days followed by seven pill-free days) for six cycles. After three cycles an intermediate visit was scheduled to assess acceptance and compliance. A total of 1633 women completed the study without violation of the protocol and were considered valid cases. Of these, 338 had used the 30 p g ethinylestradiol preparation and 1295 had used the 20 pg ethinylcstradiol preparation. An analysis of the cases that were considered invalid revealed that the most frequent reasons for exclusion werc incorrect observation time (second assessnient not within the sixth treatment cycle) in 27%. incorrect blood sample (broken tubes or incorrcct sample size) in 25% and dropout (unspecified discontinuation of the study medication) in 24%.
Blood samples for measurement of hemostatic paramcters were taken during the last cycle before oral contraceptive use began and during the sixth treatment cycle. Citrated blood samples were sent to a central laboratory for hemostatic analysis. Aliquots of platelet-poor plasma were prepared and shock-frozen at -80°C. All measurements on stored plasma were undertaken in series and were completed within a period of 6 months.
The plasma concentrations ofprothrombin frag-
ment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2@,Behring Werke, Marburg,
Germany) and the D-dirner fibrin degradation

products (D-Dimer', Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) were determined by cornmercially available enzyme-linked irnmunosorbent assays. Prothrombin is a zymogen and inactive. Activation of coagulation, however, results in the proteolytic cleavage of thrombin, releasing F1+2. F1+2 therefore reflects the thrombin generation rate and has been found to reflect accurately both an increase and a decrease of procoagulant activity"'. Fibrin that is generated by the continuous procoagulant activity must be degradated by adequate fibrinolytic activity. Fibrin degradation products such as the I)-dimer fragment therefore reflect the fibrinolytic activity directly. However, under steady-state conditions fibrin degradation depends largely on the generation rate of fibrin. Therefore, in healthy subjects D-Dimer may be used as a grand total assay of hemostatic activity, reflecting both coagulatory as well as fibrinolytic baseline activity. F1+2 levels above 2.5 nmol/l and D-Dimer levels above 800 n g / d were considered as not plausible. These values exceeded the upper limits of the normal range by more than 100%,and were probably the result of inadequate blood collection or handling (Table 1).
The activities of antithrombin 111 (Chromogenix, Sweden), protein C (Chromogenix) and protein S (Boehringer-Mannheim) were measured by means of chroniogenic substrates, using commercially available assays. Values below 60% of normal values were considered suggestive of a congenital deficiency if the values were confirmed in a subsequent measurement.
The target variable ofthe study was the D-dimer fibrin degradation product. There were only 35 otherwise valid cases which had to be excluded because of unplausibly high D-Dimer levels. The identification and exclusion of these cases was done

before the randomization code was broken. Any exclusion of data was controlled for bias by separate analyses of the relevant demographic and anamnestic variables, as well as by intention-totreat analysis.To assess the effects of treatment, the differences between laboratory values after 6 months of treatment and before treatment were computed. The two treatment groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. This non-parametric procedure was chosen instead of Student's t-test because the t-test requires normally distributed data and we knew from pilot studies that the distributions of all laboratory variables cannot be expected to be normal, even after the use of a logarithmic transformation.We also consideredthe efficiency of the Wilcoxon test to be superior to the t-test, especially in cases of skewed distributions. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The two groups were similarwith respect to demographic data, including number of births, age at menarche, cycle regularity, averagelength of cycle, menstrual flow, intermenstrual bleeding, amenorrhea, use of alcohol and smoking habits, age and previous use of oral contraceptives. Because of the inclusion procedure, no participant of the comparative study had a personal or family history of thromboembolic disease. However, a family history is important if positive, but should be evaluated with caution if negative. Some women may not know of or may not remember the thromboembolic diseases that their relatives had. In this respect it is relevant to note that we found a considerable prevalence (3.75per 1000) of hemostatic abnormalities suggestive of congenital deficiencies of the coagulation inhibitors in the study cohort at baseline. Because the hemostatic assessment of the pretreatment and treatment (6 months) observations were performed in a random sequence, we did not know of this potential predisposition until the final evaluation. In fact, of the ten women identified as having abnormally low activities of at least one inhibitor of coagulation (antithrombin 111, protein C or protein S) before oral contraceptive use, eight completed the study protocol without violation and were included in the final analysis. Unfortunately, one of these predisposed women suffered a thromboembolic

complication during treatment. She was in cycle 2 of the 20 pg ethinylestradiol formulation when a deep-venous thrombosis of the left external iliac and femoral vein was diagnosed by Doppler ultrasound and confirmed by phlebography. Immediate intravenous high-dose heparin therapy was started and use of the study medication was discontinued. Evaluation ofher pretreatment assessment revealed that both protein C and S activities were below 60% of normal. The remaining seven predisposed women (two with abnormally low antithrombin 111 activity, one with low protein S activity and four with low protein C activity) completed the 6-month treatment protocol (four in the 20 pg ethinylestradiol group and three in the 30 pg ethinylestradiolgroup) without any complications. No other cases of thrombotic disease occurred.
The results are given in Table 1. Absolute values from the pretreatment assessment and the assessment in the sixth treatment cycle are given as
means k SD and treatment effects were computed
by calculating the differences (Table 2). Oral contraceptive use resulted in an increase in
hemostatic activities over the pretreatment values. Fibrin generation and degradation as depicted by the D-dimer fibrin degradation products was increased over pretreatment values by 36% in the 20 pg ethinylestradiol group and by 42.4% in the 30 pg ethinylestradiolgroup. Procoagulant activity
as assessed by the plasma concentration of F1 + 2
increased markedly over pretreatment values, most notably in the 30 pg ethinylestradiol group. Also, the increase in protein C activity was more pronounced in that group. Antithrombin 111and protein S activities decreased in the users of each preparation, more pronouncedly in the 30 pg ethinylestradiol group.
The difference between the two groups with regard to the increase in D-dimer fibrin degradation
products was significant @ = 0.019). Thep-values
for F1 + 2 and protein C activities were above
0.05. However, for the decrease in antithrombin 111and protein S activities the p-values were 0.038 and < 0.001, respectively.

The hemostatic system is continuously active even when there is no evidence of injury to the vascular system'().The present finding of noticeable plasma levels of reaction products of both thrombin

generation and fibrin turnover before beginning

oral contraceptives confirm the hypothesis of a

considerable baseline activity of intravascular co-

agulation and fibrinolysis. These activities require

adequate regulation by thrombin inhibitors and the

fibrinolytic system. Thrombin inhibitors circulate

at high plasma concentrations, thereby limiting

coagulant activity to the site of the endothelial

damage. Therefore, the half-life of thrombin is in

the milliseconds range. It has been

that

patients with insufficiencies of these regulatory

mechanisms are at increased risk of thrombotic

disease. Interestingly, manifestation of thrombotic

disease in these patients is linked with risk fac-

tors that induce additional procoagulant activity.

Among these triggers, besides surgery, pregnancy

and immobilization, there is also the use of

combined oral contraceptives”. A recent case-con-

trol study in families with congenital deficiencies

provided conclusive evidence for the role of oral

contraceptives in inducing thromboembolic dis-

ease in women deficient in antithrombin 111’.

Although in that study women with protein C or

protein S deficiency were found to be less sensitive

for induction of thromboembolic disease during

oral contraceptive use, a recent case-control study

in women with resistance to activated protein C

revealed that carriers of this mutation carry an

eight-fold relative risk of developing thrombo-

embolic risk when using oral contraceptives’.

In our cohort of 1633 evaluable women an

overall prevalence of 4.9 per 1000 for abnormally

low activities ofat least one thrombin inhibitor was

found. W e observed one case of deep-venous

thrombosis. This case occurred in one of the pre-

disposed women, in whom the analysis of the

pretreatment blood sample revealed a protein C activity of 56%and a protein S activity of 58%. Her
pretreatment F1 + 2 (0.58 nmol/l) and D-dimer
(128 ng/ml) levels were normal. This case provides prospective evidence for the concept of a particular predisposition to thromboembolic complications of oral contraceptive use in women with coagulation inhibitor deficiencies. Although this risk might be more pronounced in antithrombin I11 deficiencys at least a combination of protein C and protein S deficiency must be considered as an important risk factor. Trauchst-Van Horn and cow o r k e r ~ ’ ~ev, aluating a large cohort of protein C-deficient patients, came to a similar conclusion. Although a history of thrombotic disease in other members of the family indicates a potential congenital deficiency of coagulation inhibitors, there are cases (as in this study) in which no such family history can be obtained”’. Nevertheless, the present data clearly indicate that efforts should be encouraged to identi6 these predisposed women before prescription of combined oral contraceptives. Family history currently appears to be the best screening tool to select women for detailed analysis of congenital abnormalities of the inhibitors of coagulation2’.
It can be argued that it is the procoagulant activity induced, for example, by oral contraceptive use that triggers thrombotic disease in predisposed womenI5.Because procoagulant activity appears to be related to the ethinylestradiol dose, at least in
users of low- to high-dose preparation^",'^.'^ the
risk ofpredisposed women should be reduced with low-dose formulations. The retrospective analysis of epidemiological data has suggested that deepvenous thrombosis” and cerebral thrombosis’*

are significantly more frequent in users of oral contraceptives containing 50 pg ethinylestradiol and more than in users of oral contraceptives containing 30 pg ethinylestradiol.
Earlier work on fibrinopeptide A, a reaction product which is cleaved from fibrinogen by the action of thrombin, suggested that a further reduction in ethinylestradiol dose might yield not just a quantitative but a qualitative improvement: there was no increase in fibrinopeptide A generation in users of 20 pg ethinylestradiol combined with 150 pg desogestrel". Comp and Z a c d 2suggested a revision of the current restrictions in predisposed women and prescription of these ultra-low-dose oral contraceptives in some cases of coagulation abnormalities. However, the present data clearly demonstrate that there is a clinically significant increase in procoagulant activity, as evidenced by
enhanced generation of the F1 + 2 prothrombin
fragment, even in users of oral contraceptives containing ultra-low doses of ethinylestradiol. These data also suggest a reduced but prevalent risk of thrombotic disease in predisposed users of preparations containing 20 pg ethinylestradiol, and confirm recent findings23of increased plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin 111 complexes in users of such formulations. However, although we confirmed that the use of the formulation containing 20 pg ethinylestradiol is associated with an increase in the procoagulant activity, the impact on the hemostatic system was noticeably less than with the formulation containing 30 pg ethinylestradiol. The overall activation of the hemostatic system, as depicted by the D-dimer fibrin degradation products, was significantly less with the 20 pgethinylestradiol

formulation. Also, the reduction in antithrombin 111 and protein S activities was strikingly less pronounced in the users of the preparation containing 20 pg ethinylestradiol.
We conclude that there is an increase in procoagulant activity and fibrin turnover in users of combined oral contraceptives, which might act as a trigger of thrombotic disease in predisposed women. However, the impact on hemostatic activity was significantly less pronounced in users of oral contraceptives containing 20 pg ethinylestradiol than in users of formulations containing 30 pg ethinylestradiol. Also, the reduced effects on antithrombin I11 and protein S activities suggest an improved safety with regard to thromboembolic risks. However, the case of a deep-venous thrombosis in the 20 pg ethinylestradiol group also demonstrates that predisposed women should refrain completely from using combined oral contraceptives. Although not all ofthese predisposed women may be identifiable before oral contraceptive prescription, at least a considerable fraction may be recognized by taking a thorough personal and family history2' and, if positive, investigating the coagulation-inhibiting system in detail2'.
