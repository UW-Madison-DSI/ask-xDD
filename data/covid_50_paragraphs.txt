Thus, the rate of data-driven behaviour change p(t) can be defined as p(t) = news(t) = news(t) , max{news(t), t ∈ NT} t ∈ NT = {1, … , 38}, then we obtain the rate of behaviour change in the Shaanxi province of China during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza epidemic from September 3 to October 10 (the first wave), which together with new hospital notifications has been used to estimate all unknown parameters (OR0, OR1, OR2, OR3, OR4, ������, ������, ������, ������, ������) of Equation 6. We took account of agent heterogeneity by allowing each individual parameter to vary across a distribution (ie, the same mean but different standard deviation), from which agents sampled their values using log-normal distributions for the ORk(k = 0, 1, … , 4) (ie, ORk ∼ exp{N(������, ������2)}) and normal distributions for ������, ������, ������, ������, and ������.The proposed iSEIR model is shown as in Figure II_iSEIR model Illustration below: pij qjk ∑Si ∑Ej ∑Ik

Using the concept of Turning Phase and the application of the iSEIR model on February 10, 2020, based on 3 weeks of available daily data (from Jan. 23, 2020 to Feb. 10,2020) released by NHC of China, our simulation successfully modeled the future pattern of official data released almost 3 weeks later, as shown by the conclusion below (the reports from [29]-[30], the corresponding simulations’ inputs by applying iSERI model given by Appendix I with incorporation of the official data released by NHC of China as of Feb. 10, 2020).4, right-hand panels) all fall within the 95% projection interval of 0% and 10% seasonality until late August 2021; while the assumption of 10% seasonality leads to an excellent agreement between the median prediction and the hospital data prior to the peak in late July 2021. The median deaths are again an overestimate, likely due to improvements in medical treatments that were applied as we progressed through 2021. In addition, we included in later Roadmaps a correlation between the mortality risk and hospital occupancy, meaning smaller waves in the summer of 2021 would be associated with relatively lower deaths than the major wave of January 2021.Early Illness dPresence of two or more of the following features: fever (might be subjective), chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, sore throat or rhinorrhea

We note that, because the input-to-peak of hospitalization map H(u; x) is parametrized by the instantaneous state of the system x, the set Ux is also parametrized by x. When the set Ux is (point-wise in time) convex, a suitable control function t → u(t) can be obtained as a solution of the following dynamical system: u˙ = PUx u − η(∂φ(u) + ∂uF (u)∂ψ(ı)) − u, where η > 0 is a tunable parameter of the controller, and PUx denotes the Euclidean projection operator, namely, given z ∈ Rn and a convex set U ⊆ Rn,being susceptible to be infected by the SARS-Cov2 virus, the fraction having been exposed to it, the fraction infected, and the fraction removed (including recoveries and deceases), the epidemic is assumed to obey the following continuous-time dynamics:   ds dt (t) de dt (t) = −β(t)i(t)s(t) = β(t)i(t)s(t) − γe(t)  di dt (t) dr dt (t) = γe(t) − δi(t) = δi(t) s(t) + e(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1 where: • β(t), t ∈ R, represents the time-varying virus transmission rate; • γ denotes the rate at which the exposed subject develops the disease (this includes people presenting symptoms and asymptomatics).2.2.

Aerosol < 5 μm in diameter(10,22) However, there is no consensus on the exact size criterion of an aerosol(22) Sufficiently small to remain suspended in air for several minutes or more(10,22) Can be disseminated by air currents throughout a room or facility(10) Lower respiratory tract is thought to be the main inoculation site(8−10) Low doses of virus may be sufficient(8) % of particles of this size emitted during exhalation % of particles of this size emitted during cough or sneeze between 0.5 and < 1 μm, and 13% between 1 μm and < 5 μm(21)2. Increased complacency: for this scenario, we include another behavior change in the model, whereby the relative per-contact probability of transmission increases back to its pre-outbreak value after the 14-day average of new locally-transmitted cases falls below 2. Following the detection of new cases, the probability of someone with symptoms getting tested is assumed to increase as testing capacity is scaled up would result in policy actions comparable to those that have been implemented in the past (i.e., localized school and workplace closures following the detection of more than 5 locally-transmitted cases), but we assume that mask/NPI compliance would not increase again.Table 2.

1. although the data is taken during the lock-down period the actual effect of the lock-down is seen later (mostly from April 9), this important contribution of lock-down will be discussed in a later section,
2. some preliminary studies have shown that the virus becomes weaker in hot and humid weather, so the upcoming summer in India and the northern hemisphere will prohibit the spread to a certain extent,
3. some Indian states are doing very well in controlling the spread of the medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.20085902.this version posted May 8, 2020.

In equation (15), ������̅ is the average of COVID-19 data and better fits provide the regression coefficient (R2) values close to unity and Obj2 to zero valueProposition 2.3, we have       ρ gr S(t )I (t ), S(t )I (t ) ≤ ρ gr S(t )I (t ), S(t )I (t ) + ρ gr S(t )I (t ), S(t )I (t )       ≤ ρ gr (I (t ), 0ˆ (t ))ρ gr S(t ), S(t ) + ρ gr S(t ), 0ˆ (t ) ρ gr I (t ), I (t )     ≤ Nmax ρ gr S(t ), S(t ) + Nmax ρ gr I (t ), I (t ) .To identify, appraise and summarize evidence related to the following questions about public health and health system impacts of the three major SARS-CoV-2 VOC as known in April 2021 (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1):
1. What is known about the implications of the three priority VOC for public-health measures on: a) Modifying approach to vaccination (e.g., using vaccines that offer greater protection against variants, using different vaccines for first and second doses and/or re-vaccinating those initially vaccinated with vaccines with limited efficacy for new strains) b) Modifying infection-prevention (i.e., public-health) measures in the community (e.g., changing duration of hand washing; changing mask type and characteristics, double masking, or other changes to masking; and changes to physical and temporal distancing) c) Modifying infection-control procedures, such as: ▪ Changing duration for quarantining of exposed or potentially exposed individuals ▪ Changing duration for isolating suspected or confirmed cases (e.g., for exposed health workers) ▪ Changing testing strategy, including approach to testing, frequency of testing, and turn-around time for test results ▪ Changing approach to contact tracing ▪ Changing approach to outbreak management m(ewd2hR.ixcihv pwWraesphrnianotttdciosei:rhtkitfntipeosd:/wb/dynoip.oearegbr/1or0eu.v1it1e0wth1)/ei2s0t2ihm1e.0ap5u.lt2ihc0o.ar2/f1tui2no5dn7e5rs,1w7o;htfohithshavesegrstrihaonnrteepdoesmtpeeddrRiMoxarivyita2y2li,cV2e0nO2se1C.toTfhdoeisrcpolhapyeyrtaihgehlttphhreospldryiensrt ftionerpmtheirspeptrueiptyr.int arrangement (parIttiiscmualaderlayvafiolarblehuonsdepriataClCs-)BYo-nN:C-ND 4.0 International license ABM: Agent-based Model AGREE II: Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation aIRR: adjusted incidence rate ratios B.1.1.7: variant of concern originating in the United Kingdom, also known as VUI 202012/01 and VOC 202012/01 B.1.351: variant of concern originating in South Africa, also known as 20H/501Y.V2 BMI: body mass index CanCOGen: Canadian COVID Genomics Network CENTRAL: Central Register of Controlled Trials CFR: Case Fatality Rates CI: confidence interval CIDRAP: Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy Ct: cycle threshold, provides a relative measure of viral quantity COG-UK: COVID-19 Genomics UK CDSR: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews dQALY: discounted quality-adjusted life years E484K: escape mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, present in B.1.1.7 ECDC: European Centres for Disease Control FDA: Food and Drug Administration HCW: healthcare workers HR: Hazard Ratio HVAC: heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ICU: Intensive Care Unit IQR: interquartile range IR: incidence rate LOS: length of stay mRNA: messenger ribonucleic acid NGS: next generation sequencing NOS: Newcastle-Ottawa scale NPI: Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions NRW: North-Rhine Westphalia OR: odds ratio P.1: variant of concern originating in Brazil, also known as B.1.28.1 PCR: polymerase chain reaction, method for DNA replication and genome sequencing PHU: Public Health Unit PPE: personal protective equipment PR: prevalence ratio R: reproduction R0: basic reproduction number, expected number of cases generated by one case in a population when everyone is susceptible to infection Rt: effective reproduction number iv medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.20.21257517; this version posted May 22, 2021141 We model a vaccine that reduces symptomatic infection by 90% (approximately in line with vac-
142 cine efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines) in two ways: 1) by reducing infection but
143 not impacting disease progression (V Esusceptibility = 0.9, V Einfectiousness = 0, V Eprogression = 0),
144 hereafter referred to as ‘susceptibility-only vaccine’ or by 2) reducing both infection and the prob-
145 ability of symptoms given infection (V Esusceptibility = 0.67, V Einfectiousness = 0, V Eprogression =

147 so that the observed impact on symptomatic disease is the same (i.e., (1 − V Esusceptibility) × (1 −
