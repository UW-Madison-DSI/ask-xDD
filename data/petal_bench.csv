1058,An estimated one third of the world�s population (or z500 million persons) were infected and had clinically apparent illnesses during the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic.
1070,"None of the modern descendant influenza viruses are as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu (Spanish Influenza) H1N1 virus. Apparently, the porcine H1N1 and H3N2 lineages uncommonly infect humans, and the human H1N1 and H3N2 lineages have both been associated with substantially lower rates of illness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, current H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2 lineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present)."
1079,"A public events ban intervention refers to the government's decision to ban all public events of a certain size or number of participants, usually more than 100 people, in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This intervention is one of the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented by many governments to control the epidemic."
1093,"The second wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic spread globally from September to November 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, a third wave occurred in early 1919."
1096,"Circulating human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed because of the phenomenon of viral antigenic drift. Viral antigenic drift is a process by which the influenza virus undergoes genetic mutations that result in the emergence of new strains that are capable of evading the immunity developed by the host population. These new strains can cause recurrent annual outbreaks, and the emergence of a new antigenic variant virus that becomes dominant approximately every 2 to 3 years. This process allows the virus to continue to circulate in the population, causing annual epidemics."
1106,"It is unclear whether the first and third waves of the 1918 swine flu pandemic were caused by the same virus or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu. The only influenza RNA-positive human samples from before 1918, and from all 3 waves, can answer this question. However, the only 1918 pandemic Virus samples that have been identified so far are from second-wave patients, so nothing can yet be said about whether the first (spring) wave, or for that matter, the third wave, represented circulation of the same Virus or variants of it."
1123,"While data bearing on influenza Virus human cell adaptation (e.g., receptor binding) are beginning to be understood at the molecular level, the basis for Viral adaptation to efficient human-to-human spread, the chief prerequisite for pandemic emergence, is unknown for any influenza Virus. So, the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus is not fully understood."
1151,The presence of 2019-nCoV virus was detected in the blood of 6 out of 57 patients and in the anal swabs of 11 out of 28 patients.
1160,"The presence of virus RNA in the blood and anal swab is positively correlated with the severe disease stage. All of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, and 8 of the 11 patients with anal swab virus-positive were in severe clinical stage. In the anal swab cohort, the presence of virus RNA in the anal digestive tract was also positively correlated with disease severity."
1171,"The study found that the presence of viral RNA in the blood and anal swab is a strong indicator for the further clinical severity, particularly for those with severe symptoms. Therefore, monitoring virus RNA in blood and the digestive tract, on top of the respiratory tract, might benefit disease prediction and indicate the requirement of special care."
1172,"The high concentration of viral RNA in anal swabs suggests that the digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication. The study found that the presence of virus RNA in the anal digestive tract was positively correlated with disease severity. The study suggests that early monitoring of virus RNA in the digestive tract, on top of the respiratory tract, might benefit disease prediction."
1174,"According to the paper, rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body."
1179,"Ribozymes, which are catalytic RNAs closely related to viroids, are entities with zero genes that fulfill many criteria for early life. They were recovered in vitro from 10^15 molecules (aptamers), 220 nucleotides in length, by 10 rounds of selection. Among the many RNA species present in this collection of quasispecies RNAs were catalytically active members, enzymatically active or viroids fulfilling several criteria of life."
1180,"Ribozymes, tRNA-like molecules, and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA quasispecies that can satisfy criteria for life. These RNA species can bind amino acids and replicate themselves in the appropriate environment."
1182,"RNA replication can be performed chemically from RNA without polymerase enzymes. In addition, deoxyribozymes can form from ribonucleotides. Thus, DNA can arise from RNA and replicate in the nucleus using host enzymes. However, the presence of the Qβ replicase enzyme was still necessary in some studies."
1189,"Without intervention from 5 February onwards, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively."
1190,"With the intervention of movement restrictions starting on 5th February 2020, the cumulative incidence among passengers with and without close contact and crew members were 102, 47 and 48 cases, respectively, as of 24 February 2020."
1194,The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is about 5.0 days.
1196,"The movement restriction policy on the Diamond Princess cruise ship started on 5th February 2020 was highly successful in greatly reducing the number of secondary transmissions on board. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February onwards, and at most there was, on average, one case of infection per day from 8 to 10 February."
1202,"The World Health Organization (WHO) was first notified about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan City, China on December 31, 2019."
1205,Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were initially developed to screen for SARS-CoV-2.
1212,The fatality rate reported for MERS was 34%.
1217,Superspreading is a phenomenon where a case of an infectious disease infects significantly more contacts than the average. It was observed during the SARS outbreak and also during the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea.
1218,Up to 5 million people may have left Wuhan before travel restrictions were imposed.
1220,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly Culex species. Pigs and wild birds are the natural reservoirs of the virus, and humans can become infected when they are bitten by infected mosquitoes that have fed on infected animals. The virus cannot be transmitted from person to person."
1223,Q130 is located in transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) of the nonstructural NS4B protein.
1224,Manidipine is a dihydropyridine (DHP) voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) antagonist that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into cells. It is approved for the long-term treatment of hypertension and has been shown to have antiviral activity against JEV and ZIKV by reducing the viral load and inhibiting viral replication.
1229,"The seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) of flaviviruses participate in viral replication, virion assembly, and virus escape from immune surveillance. They are involved in various stages of the viral life cycle, including viral RNA replication, translation, and processing, as well as the formation of the viral replication complex and the evasion of host immune responses. NS4B, for example, is part of the viral replication complex and is supposed to anchor the viral replicase to the ER membrane, while the N-terminal 125-amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B is indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response."
1231,HTS stands for High-Throughput Screening. It is a method used in drug discovery to rapidly test large numbers of compounds for their ability to interact with a target molecule or to have a particular biological effect. HTS assays are typically automated and can screen thousands or even millions of compounds in a relatively short period of time.
1242,"There is a need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. Moreover, improved understanding of immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens has raised the possibility of a universal vaccine, and these universal antigens will likely require novel vaccines for effective delivery. Therefore, new types of influenza vaccines that can induce broad and efficacious immunity to the influenza virus, including universal vaccines, are needed."
1246,"One of the issues with present vaccines is that the immunodominant portions of the HA and NA molecules undergo a constant process of antigenic drift, a natural accumulation of mutations, enabling virus evasion from immunity. Thus, the circulating influenza A and B strains are reviewed annually for antigenic match with current vaccines. This process limits the effectiveness of current vaccines and necessitates the development of new vaccines that can provide cross-clade protection."
1247,"The general types of influenza vaccines available in the United States are trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; in trivalent and quadrivalent forms). There are three types of inactivated vaccines that include whole virus inactivated, split virus inactivated, and subunit vaccines. In split virus vaccines, the virus is disrupted by a detergent. In subunit vaccines, HA and NA have been further purified by removal of other viral components."
1248,"There are three types of inactivated vaccines that include whole virus inactivated, split virus inactivated, and subunit vaccines. In whole virus inactivated vaccines, the virus is inactivated by chemical or physical means. In split virus inactivated vaccines, the virus is disrupted by a detergent. In subunit vaccines, HA and NA have been further purified by removal of other viral components. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) are examples of inactivated vaccines that are available. TIV is administered intramuscularly and contains three or four inactivated viruses, i.e., two type A strains (H1 and H3) and one or two type B strains."
1262,"SARS-CoV is a zoonotic coronavirus that causes acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in infected patients. Many infected patients have ALI, a condition that is diagnosed based on the presence of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure without a cardiac cause. In some patients, there is a progression to the more severe form of ALI, ARDS."
1279,"According to the passage, MERS-CoV patients had increased morbidity and mortality if they were obese, immunocompromised, diabetic, or had cardiac disease. These medical comorbidities were found to have a profound influence on MERS-CoV outcomes."
1477,The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is administered as a nasal spray.
1480,"No, LAIV (live attenuated influenza vaccine) are temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted, so they do not replicate effectively at core body temperature. Instead, they replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx."
1488,"The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) relies on antigenic match, and the HA and NA antigens are replaced on the same schedule as the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The replacement of vaccine strains may occur regularly, and annual vaccination is recommended to assure protection."
1489,"The LAIV relies on antigenic match, and the HA and NA antigens are replaced on the same schedule as the TIV. The replacement of vaccine strains may occur regularly, and annual vaccination is recommended to assure protection. For the northern hemisphere, vaccine strain selection occurs in February, and then manufacturers begin production, taking at least six months to produce the millions of vaccine doses required for the fall."
1503,"Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is the most studied serotype because it has been extensively tested for gene delivery and anti-cancer agents, as well as for infectious attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Additionally, Ad5 has been tested as a vaccine vector for a variety of diseases, including influenza and HIV. However, one drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, which can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use. This is why alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes."
1535,"The rAd5-vectored HIV vaccine was tested as part of a Step Study, a phase 2B clinical trial. In this study, individuals were vaccinated with the Ad5 vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes. The vaccine induced HIV-specific T cell responses; however, the study was stopped after interim analysis suggested the vaccine did not achieve efficacy and individuals with high preexisting Ad5 antibody titers might have an increased risk of acquiring HIV-1. Subsequently, the rAd5 vaccine-associated risk was confirmed."
1544,"One disadvantage of the inclusion of non-HA antigens to HA-based vaccines is that both CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, and immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use. However, the efficacy of non-HA antigens has led to their inclusion with HA-based vaccines to improve immunogenicity and broaden the breadth of both humoral and cellular immunity."
1549,"One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, which can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use. This is why alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes."
1553,"Low prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity. Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from these low-prevalence serotypes have been shown to be efficacious."
1568,"One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels. This property makes replicon systems attractive as vaccine vectors."
1571,"The VEE (Venezuelan equine encephalitis) replicon system has several advantages as a vaccine vector. One important feature is the self-replicating nature of the RNA, which allows for high-level expression of transgenes. Additionally, the replicon systems do not encode viral structural proteins, which are provided in cell culture production systems. The VEE replicon system targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, priming rapid and robust immune responses. VEE replicon systems can induce robust mucosal immune responses through intranasal or subcutaneous immunization, and have been shown to induce potent HA-specific immune responses and protect from challenge in murine models. Furthermore, the VEE replicon system has been shown to induce CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses, and has been well tolerated and considered safe in clinical trials."
1574,"The phase I clinical trial with the CMV VRP showed the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing CMV-neutralizing antibody responses and potent T cell responses. Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and considered safe."
1575,A baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use and was first available for use in the United States for the 2013-2014 influenza season.
1576,"Baculoviruses have a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. The viruses have been extensively studied for protein expression and for pesticide use and so are readily manipulated. The vectors can accommodate large gene insertions, show limited cytopathic effect in mammalian cells, and have been shown to infect and express genes of interest in a spectrum of mammalian cells. Additionally, baculovirus has been extensively used to produce recombinant proteins and a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use."
1579,The first reported vaccine using baculovirus vectors for influenza was Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expressing the HA of PR8 under control of the CAG promoter (AcCAG-HA).
1583,"The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector has a number of appealing qualities as a vaccine vector. As an avian virus, there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans, and NDV propagates to high titers in both chicken eggs and cell culture. As a paramyxovirus, there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events, and the levels of gene expression are driven by the proximity to the leader sequence at the 3' end of the viral genome. This gradient of gene expression enables attenuation through rearrangement of the genome, or by insertion of transgenes within the genome. Finally, pathogenicity of NDV is largely determined by features of the fusion protein enabling ready attenuation of the vaccine vector."
1586,"The first report on the NDV vector test concluded that recombinant NDV expressing the HA protein of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) was attenuated compared to the parental vaccine strain, induced a robust serum antibody response, and protected against homologous influenza virus challenge in a murine model of infection."
1598,"The most common virus detected in community members in this sample was Coronavirus OC43, which was detected in 13.3% (95% CI 6.9-23.6%) of people in the community and not in any of the clinical samples."
1602,"Symptoms associated with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) include sore throat, fever, cough, running nose, vomiting, body ache, leg pain, nausea, chills, and shortness of breath."
1617,Insulin and low-molecular-weight heparin have shown promise for in vivo delivery via dry powder inhalers.
1626,At least 170 million people worldwide are persistently infected with hepatitis C virus.
1646,"Poxvirus-vectored vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use, including fowlpox-and canarypox-vectored vaccines for avian and equine influenza viruses, respectively. Currently, at least ten poxvirus-vectored vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use. However, poxvirus-vectored vaccines have not yet been approved for use in humans."
1647,"A number of studies have shown that immunization with NP (nucleoprotein) expressed by various viral vectors induces potent CD8+ T cell responses and protects against influenza virus challenge. As the NP protein is highly conserved across influenza A viruses, NP-specific T cells can protect against heterologous and even heterosubtypic virus challenges. Studies have also shown that antibodies to the M2 protein protected against homologous and heterosubtypic challenge, including a H5N1 HPAIV challenge. More recently, NP and M2 have been combined to induce broadly cross-reactive CD8+ T cell and antibody responses, and rAd5 vaccines expressing these antigens have been shown to protect against pH1N1 and H5N1 challenges."
1652,"An improved vaccine regime might include the use of a vectored influenza virus vaccine that expresses the HA, NA, and M and/or NP proteins for the two currently circulating influenza A subtypes and both influenza B strains so that vaccine take and vaccine antigen levels are not an issue in inducing protective immunity. Recombinant live-attenuated or replication-deficient influenza viruses may offer an advantage for this and other approaches."
1659,The most common species of Human Coronavirus among adults is HCoV-OC43.
1718,The case fatality rates of SARS and MERS ranged from 14% to 45%.
1719,The common HCOV strains in the 5 year USA study were HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E.
1721,"According to the paper, phage display technology has been widely and productively exploited in studies of protein-protein interactions. It has been used to create and screen libraries of peptide and folded-protein variants, generate therapeutic antibody responses for chronic diseases, cancer, immunotherapy, and immunocontraception, and develop phage-based antigens displaying peptide ligands of monoclonal antibodies for immunization of larger molecules that would be immunogenic even in isolation. Additionally, phage display technology has been used to detect cells through staining with biarsenical dye, functionalize phage with metallic silver to make them bactericidal, and devise biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance, piezoelectric transducers, linear dichroism, and magnetoelastic sensor technology."
1726,"The phage is an excellent model system for directed protein evolution because of its large population sizes, fast generation times, small genome sizes, and ease of manipulation. The phage can be engineered to encode an exogenous protein, whose functional activity triggers gene III expression from an accessory plasmid, and variants of the exogenous protein arise by random mutagenesis during phage replication. By supplying limiting amounts of receptive E. coli cells to the engineered phage variants, phage infectivity and production of offspring can be linked with the presence of a desired protein phenotype. Additionally, phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) allows multiple rounds of evolution per day with little experimental intervention, making it a powerful tool for directed protein evolution."
1730,"The bacteriophage technology and the library of folded protein variants have enabled the ability to seamlessly connect genetic information with protein function for a large number of protein variants simultaneously. This has been widely and productively exploited in studies of protein-protein interactions. The phage display technology has been an invaluable tool for studies of protein-protein interactions for the past 25 years. The library technology was developed and refined to create and screen libraries of peptide and folded-protein variants, and phage-based antigens displaying peptide ligands of monoclonal antibodies were also generated for immunization. Additionally, the phage has practical uses in protein engineering and directed protein evolution, due to its unique tolerance of genetic modifications that allow biomolecules to be displayed on the virion surface."
1736,"In the context of the paper, the term ""phage display"" refers to a recombinant filamentous phage displaying a single polypeptide sequence on its surface (or more rarely, bispecific display achieved via fusion of polypeptides to two different capsid proteins), and the term ""phage-displayed library"" refers to a diverse pool of recombinant filamentous phage displaying an array of polypeptide variants (e.g., antibody fragments; peptides)."
1738,"The paper mentions several characteristics of filamentous phage that have been demonstrated, including its unique biological, immunological, and physicochemical properties, its ability to display a variety of biomolecules in modular fashion, and its relative simplicity and ease of manipulation. Additionally, the paper notes that the filamentous phage has been shown to have high immunogenicity, relative antigenic simplicity, and the ability to activate a range of immune responses, making it an excellent particulate vaccine carrier. The phage has also been used as a scaffold for bioconjugation and surface chemistry, and as an engine for evolving variants of displayed proteins with novel functions. Finally, the paper mentions that the filamentous phage has been shown to modulate host phenotype, including the virulence of important human and crop pathogens, either through direct effects of phage replication on cell growth and physiology, or by horizontal transfer of genetic material contained within episomes and/or chromosomally integrated prophage."
1747,"According to the paper, one reason for the lack of success of immunization with phage-displayed peptides with native protein is that peptide antigens elicit a set of topologically restricted antibodies that are largely unable to recognize discontinuous or complex epitopes on larger biomolecules. While the peptide may mimic the chemistry of a given epitope on a folded protein, being a smaller molecule, it cannot mimic the topology of that antibody's full epitope."
1749,"The paper states that the phage particle is immunogenic without adjuvant in all species tested to date, including mice, rats, rabbits, and humans."
1754,"Biodistribution studies of the phage after intravenous injection show that it is cleared from the blood within hours through the reticuloendothelial system, particularly of the liver and spleen, where it is retained for days, potentially activating marginal-zone B-cell responses."
1756,"According to the paper, a future potential of filamentous phage is its use as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for infectious and chronic diseases, including cancer and autoimmunity. The phage can be modified to express a targeting moiety specific for pathogenic cells and/or proteins, and it has been shown to be internalized into breast tumor cells, resulting in GFP expression. Additionally, unmodified filamentous phage may be of future interest as elements of combination therapeutics against certain drug-resistant infections."
1764,"The paper mentions that for more than a decade, interest in the filamentous phage as a building block for nanomaterials has been growing because of its unique physicochemical properties, with emerging applications in magnetics, optics, and electronics. It also states that Lee et al. (2002) engineered M13 phage to display a ZnS-binding peptide on pIII and showed that, in the presence of ZnS nanoparticles, they self-assemble into highly ordered film biomaterials that can be aligned using magnetic fields. Additionally, the paper mentions that the unique physicochemical properties of the phage, in combination with modular display of peptides and proteins with known binding specificity, have spawned wholly novel materials with diverse applications, such as photocatalytic water splitting, light harvesting, photoresponsive technologies, neural electrodes, and piezoelectric energy generation."
1765,"The filamentous phage virion is made up of a long helical capsid, ∼ 1000 nm long and 5 nm wide, made up almost entirely of overlapping pVIII monomers, each of which lies ∼ 27 angstroms from its nearest neighbor and exposes two amine groups as well as at least three carboxyl groups. The capsid encapsulates a single-stranded circular DNA genome."
1915,"Limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing during humanitarian crises."
1916,"Difficulties are exacerbated in all settings during humanitarian crises, but they are particularly exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. These difficulties include providing limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, and effective contact tracing. In addition, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill."
1917,Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing during humanitarian crises.
1919,Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing during humanitarian crises.
1921,"Respiratory hygiene is a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing. Hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30%. Furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting one's own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises."
1939,Between 3-5 million cases of severe influenza-related illness are reported every year.
1949,"The SRC-family of kinases are a group of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that play a role in signal transduction pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. They are recruited to phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in CEACAM1 isoforms, which influences downstream cellular function."
1950,"Recognition of intracellular viral RNA by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that recruit innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and NK cells, to the site of infection to assist in viral clearance."
2131,Hepcidin was first discovered in human urine.
2137,Hepcidin plays an active role in the regulation of Fe release from macrophages and in the control of excessive Fe absorption from the duodenum. It limits the amount of Fe that can be utilized by pathogens.
2144,"According to the paper, the mortality rate of influenza A virus subtype H7N9 (avian or bird flu) was more than 35%. The paper states that ""of the new A(H7N9) virus, more than 400 human cases were reported to the WHO with a mortality rate of more than 35%."
2147,"Yes, according to the paper, some sporadic cases of influenza A virus subtype H7N9 seemed to be a result of human-to-human transmissions, although most patients with A(H7N9) infections had contact with poultry or visited live animal markets. The paper states that ""most patients with A(H7N9) infections had contact with poultry or visited live animal markets. However, some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human-to-human transmissions."
2151,"Yes, coinfection is common in influenza infection. According to the paper, ""the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR."" Additionally, the paper states that ""depending on the detection method (qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence) different ratios of co-infections have been found. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that 54.5-83.3% of influenza A or B positive patients were found to have at least one concomitant respiratory viral infection."
2158,"According to the paper, patients infected with any respiratory virus who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo-treated patients in the intention-to-treat population. The paper notes that the pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed this benefit."
2164,"According to the paper, intranasal Zanamivir was effective in preventing laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness, as well as reducing viral titers, duration of shedding, and symptoms. The paper states that ""156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy. These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms."
2168,The highest childhood burden of pertussis globally is in Southeast Asia.
2179,"Yes, according to the paper, there is a dose-dependent response to carrageenan and Zanamivir intranasal therapy. The paper notes that the minimal effective dose of Zanamivir used as mono-therapy was evaluated in a lethal H1N1(09)pdm mouse model, and the lowest effective dose of Zanamivir after a treatment start 24 hpi was 1 mg/kg BW/day. Additionally, the paper states that for the H7N7 lethal infection, the minimal effective dose of Zanamivir as mono-therapy ranged between 1 and 3 mg/kg BW/day. The paper also notes that the combination of carrageenan with 3 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir used for treatment of H7N7 infected mice resulted in significantly enhanced survival of mice in comparison to both mono-therapies."
2180,"Yes, according to the paper, carrageenan and Zanamivir together have a greater benefit than either in monotherapy. The paper states that ""the combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir act synergistically against several influenza A virus strains (H1N1(09)pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7)"" and that ""the combined use of both compounds significantly increases survival of infected animals in comparison with both mono-therapies or placebo."" Additionally, the paper notes that the combination provides synergistic activity with higher protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds."
2197,"It is suspected that COVID-19 is transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions, like other known coronaviruses. Current evidence suggests that close contact with an infected person is a major factor in disease transmission. Close contact is defined as being in or within two meters of an area with a confirmed patient or being directly exposed to infectious secretions without appropriate PPE. Healthcare facilities in China have reported spread from person to person. In addition, some mildly ill or potentially even asymptomatic patients may have a higher chance of spreading the disease to others as they may be less likely to seek medical care. The possibility that patients may be infectious prior to symptom onset further compounds the difficulty of containing the virus."
2252,The residues for the PBD (peptide-binding domain) are marked in blue.
2256,"The main finding of the study is that the artificially designed peptide AP3 shows promise as a candidate for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor for clinical use. AP3 had longer half-life than T20 and was more effective than either AP2 or T20 in inhibiting infection by the laboratory-adapted strains and the primary isolates of HIV-1, including those resistant to T20."
2257,"The results suggest that AP3, an artificially designed peptide, shows promise as a candidate for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor for clinical use. AP3 had longer half-life than T20 and was more effective than either AP2 or T20 in inhibiting infection by the laboratory-adapted strains and the primary isolates of HIV-1, including those resistant to T20. The study also provides important structure and activity information for the rational design of novel artificially peptide inhibitors."
2258,"The anti-HIV-1 activity of AP3 was enhanced by the preexisting antibodies from HIV-1-infected patients. The antibodies actually enhanced the anti-HIV-1 activity of AP3, possibly because the binding of the antibodies to some sites in gp120 or gp41 promote the interaction of AP3 with viral gp41 NHR region."
2262,"The in vivo elimination half-life of AP3 is 6.02 hours, which is about 2.8-fold longer than that of T20 (1.57 hours)."
228,"In addition to clinical symptoms, healthcare providers and public health responders should consider the following risk factors when determining if a patient should be tested for COVID-19:

Recent travel from an affected area
Close contact with someone with COVID-19 or with patients with pneumonia of unknown cause
Residing in an area where there has been community spread of COVID-19

These factors can help determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether they should be tested."
238,CDC developed an rRT-PCR test to diagnose COVID-19. This test is a molecular test that detects the genetic material of the virus in respiratory specimens such as nasal or oral swabs. The test can be performed in a laboratory and is used to confirm the presence of the virus in a patient's sample.
239,The equipment in the contaminated area should be wiped with 2000mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant. The DR and CT gantry in the contaminated area should be wiped with 75% ethanol. The equipment in the buffer area should be wiped with 500-1000mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant or alcohol-containing disposable disinfectant wipes twice a day.
241,"Computed tomography (CT) can play a role in both diagnosing and categorizing COVID-19 on the basis of case definitions issued by the WHO and the treatment guidelines from the NHC. Suspected patients having the virus may undergo chest CT. The major role of chest CT is to understand the extent and dynamic evolution of lung lesions induced by COVID-19. However, note should be made that due to overlap of imaging findings with other respiratory diseases, CT is not helpful as a screening tool."
244,SARS-CoV-2 stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
2455,Periodically taking time off could lower the physical and mental stress levels of staff members working in the contaminated area.
2457,"Once a contagious infectious disease has been identified, the EMICT must consider four main areas of response: data gathering, collaboration, needs assessment, and expert advice. Data gathering includes dissemination of up-to-date case definitions and information about confirmatory tests to all staff with direct patient contact to allow appropriate barrier precautions to be taken. All typical and atypical imaging features of the disease should be made known to all radiologists to assist in recognition of the disease on images and to allow accurate reporting of these findings."
2460,"The major role of chest CT is to understand the extent and dynamic evolution of lung lesions induced by COVID-19. When combined with other epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and virus nucleic acid information, typical chest CT imaging findings are helpful for making the diagnosis of COVID-19."
2469,"The review discusses the potential anti-virus activity of IRE1 and RNaseL proteins, which contain homologous RNase domains and share the functional consequences of their activation in initiating cellular apoptosis through JNK signaling. While initial discoveries were made in the context of homeostatic and anti-viral roles for both proteins, differences between the pathways are narrowed by further advances in research. The review also suggests that IRE1 and RNaseL have the potential to lead to cell death in the context of a virus infection, but it is still not clear whether IRE1 is able to cleave any viral RNA in a manner similar to that of other RIDD targets."
2476,"CHIKV is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These mosquitoes are also responsible for the transmission of other arboviruses such as dengue and Zika. Once a mosquito bites an infected person, it becomes infected with the virus and can transmit it to other people it bites. CHIKV can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and from mother to child during delivery. There have been instances of CHIKV transmission from mother to fetus causing congenital illness and fetal death. However, during the 7 days preceding birth, no human mother has been reported to transmit the disease vertically."
2477,"CHIKV infection is marked by severe joint pain, which is the most common symptom of the disease. The joint pain is often accompanied by fever, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and arthralgia. The acute phase causes intense joint and muscular pain that makes movement very difficult and prostrates its victims. The disease gets its name from the Kimakonde vernacular language of Tanzania and Mozambique, and the word chikungunya means ''that which contorts or bends up'' and translates in Swahili to ''the illness of the bended walker''."
248,MERS-CoV stands for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
2484,"The 2005-2006 epidemic of CHIKV in La Reunion islands in the Indian Ocean spurred the discovery of a new vector species, Ae. albopictus. This epidemic peaked its devastation between January and February 2006, when over 46,000 cases came into light every week, including 284 deaths. Ae. albopictus became the main vector for CHIKV within 1-2 years after CHIKV was introduced to the region."
2492,"Asian CHIKV has continued to spread and cause epidemics in several regions since its emergence. Recent activities of CHIKV include the Indian epidemic in 2005-2006, which was followed by a sudden explosion of cases in 2007. An estimated 1.3 million people across 13 states were reported to be infected in India, and CHIKV was also widespread in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. In recent times, with an increase in global travel, the risk for spreading CHIKV to non-endemic regions has heightened. Several travelers have brought CHIKV home with them after visiting areas with actively infected populations. Such cases have been documented in European countries, Australia, Asia, and the United States. The United States has already reported at least twelve cases of travel-associated CHIKV, while France has reported 850 cases, and the United Kingdom 93."
2493,"Recent activities of CHIKV include the Indian epidemic in 2005-2006, which was followed by a sudden explosion of cases in 2007. An estimated 1.3 million people across 13 states were reported to be infected in India, and CHIKV was also widespread in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. In July-August of 2007, CHIKV was reported in Italy, probably brought in by travelers from CHIKV-prone regions of India, Africa, and Indian Ocean islands such as Mauritius, Madagascar, and Seychelles. Several travelers have brought CHIKV home with them after visiting areas with actively infected populations. Such cases have been documented in European countries, Australia, Asia, and the United States. The United States has already reported at least twelve cases of travel-associated CHIKV, while France has reported 850 cases, and the United Kingdom 93."
2498,"CHIKV infection can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and arthralgia. The acute phase of CHIKV causes such intense joint and muscular pain that makes movement very difficult and prostrates its victims. Ninety-five percent of infected adults are symptomatic after infection, and of these, most become disabled for weeks to months as a result of decreased dexterity, loss of mobility, and delayed reaction. The chronic stage of CHIKV is characterized by polyarthralgia that can last from weeks to years beyond the acute stage. More than 50% of patients who suffer from severe CHIKF are over 65 years old, and more than 33% of them die. Most adults who suffer from severe CHIKF have underlying medical conditions. Other complications associated with CHIKV, from most common to least common, include respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure."
2502,"CHIKV has been shown to attack fibroblasts, which are cells that produce the extracellular matrix and collagen, explaining the involvement of muscles, joints, and skin connective tissues. The high number of nociceptive nerve endings found within the joints and muscle connective tissues can explain pain associated with CHIKV. The acute phase of CHIKV causes such intense joint and muscular pain that makes movement very difficult and prostrates its victims. The chronic stage of CHIKV is characterized by polyarthralgia that can last from weeks to years beyond the acute stage."
2508,"The Ae. aegypti mosquito responsible for epidemics in Kenya, Comoros, and Seychelles carried CHIKV with an alanine in the 226 position of the E1 gene (E1-A226)."
2509,"When the virus struck the Reunion Islands, the decline in population of Ae. aegypti due to massive dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane usage and dearth of Ae. albopictus species' population resulted in an ecological pressure, favoring replacement of alanine at position 226 with valine (E1-A226V). This mutation allowed CHIKV's secondary vector species, Ae. albopictus, to supplement Ae. aegypti as its primary in La Reunion islands in the Indian Ocean, spurred the discovery of a new vector species, Ae. albopictus."
2526,"The report concludes that CHIKV is a mosquito-borne emerging pathogen that has a major health impact in humans and causes fever, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and arthralgia. With the threat of an emerging global pandemic, the peculiar problems associated with the more immediate and seasonal epidemics warrant the development of an effective vaccine. The report suggests that DNA-based vaccines, such as the consensus DNA vaccine developed by Muthumani et al., could play a major role in combating CHIKV. The report also emphasizes the importance of investigating a cell-mediated immune response-based vaccine against CHIKV and the need for further research in this area."
254,The clinical attack rate was 20% in the first year of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
255,The estimated R0 of COVID-19 is 2.2.

2719,"A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats’ virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence."
2738,"PaKiT01 cells are known to constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-a."
2743,"The results are supported by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of the mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell tissue cultures. Additionally, the findings were confirmed in spatially-explicit stochastic simulations of fitted time series from the mean field model."
2746,"The authors undertook a series of virus infection experiments on bat cell lines expressing divergent interferon phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model elucidating the dynamics of within-host viral spread. They evaluated their theoretical model analytically independent of the data, then fit the model to data recovered from in vitro experimental trials in order to estimate rates of within-host virus transmission and cellular progression to antiviral status under diverse assumptions of absent, induced, and constitutive immunity. Finally, they confirmed their findings in spatially-explicit stochastic simulations of fitted time series from their mean field model."
2755,"The BHRP model was simplified to the Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model, which considered the routes from the reservoir (seafood market) to people and from person to person of SARS-CoV-2."
2756,"The estimate of R 0 was 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person, which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58."
2761,"The hosts were divided into four compartments: susceptible hosts (S H), exposed hosts (E H), infected hosts (I H), and removed hosts (R H)."
2768,"The assumption of transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was that it was 0.5 times that of symptomatic infection (κ = 0.5), which was a similar value as influenza."
279,"The secretion of proinflammatory cytokines is regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is activated by various stimuli such as viral RNA, RNA cleavage products, viroporins, and disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations."
280,"Upon activation, the NLRP3 inflammasome is recruited to the mitochondria via association with mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) or mitofusin 2 expressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane."
282,Viroporins are transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins encoded by certain RNA viruses. These proteins alter membrane permeability to ions by forming membrane channels. Viroporins are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of viral infections by modulating host cell functions and immune responses.

2971,Control measures and changes in population behavior later in January should have reduced the effective reproductive number.
2977,"For influenza virus infections, virus shedding is highest on the day of illness onset and relatively higher from shortly before symptom onset until a few days after onset. For severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset."
2978,Transmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets.
2979,"Some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols, and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role."
2981,"Coronaviruses can infect the human gastrointestinal tract, and faecal-oral transmission might also play a role in this instance."
2985,"Determining the spectrum of clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV infections is important because it can help to calibrate public health responses. If the seriousness of infection is similar to the 1918/19 Spanish influenza, the same responses would be warranted for 2019-nCoV as for the most severe influenza pandemics. If, however, the seriousness of infection is similar to seasonal influenza, mitigation measures could be tuned accordingly."
2986,"Beyond the assessment of severity, it is important to determine high-risk groups, transmission dynamics, severity of the disease, immunity, and the impact of control and mitigation measures that have been applied to date."
299,"Yes, there are influenza vaccines available. While there is not yet a universal vaccine that can prevent all influenza virus infections, effective vaccines can be made for specific influenza virus strains in a short time."
2992,The paper does not provide information on the location of the Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory.
2993,The contig was assembled to an E-30 reference genome (GenBank accession number JX976773) and deemed nearly complete by comparison to the reference.
2994,The average read coverage was 260-fold for the E-30 genome.
300,"For the 2009 influenza pandemic, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in New Zealand, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012%. In New York City, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old."
3000,NTCP is a transmembrane protein that mediates bile acid transport.
3002,"The majority of HepaRG cells were found to express NTCP but not to be infected, suggesting that NTCP itself is not sufficient to allow HBV infection."
3008,"The conventional ELISAs were performed in an identical manner to the ELISA-array, except that antibodies were coated at a concentration of 2 μg/mL in PBS (pH 7.4), and substrate TMB was used instead of Super Signal ELISA Femto Maximum sensitive substrate. Three serum samples were collected from patients with nervous system symptoms and histories of tick bites. The identical antibodies used in the ELISA-array format were also tested in a conventional ELISA format to determine the difference in sensitivity and specificity. The conventional ELISAs were performed at the same time as the ELISA-array assays to ensure similar reaction conditions. The results were evaluated to optimize the ELISA-array assay. The optimization was evaluated by dot morphology and signal intensity. The positive signals were defined as a signal value > 400 and a signal value (sample)/signal value (negative) > 2. The results demonstrated that the ELISA-array had similar specificity and higher sensitivity compared with the conventional ELISAs."
3013,"The ELISA-array assay was validated using cultured viruses and inoculated chicken eggs with patient sera. The results demonstrated that this method combined the advantage of ELISA and protein array (multiplex and ease of use) and has potential for the identification of clinical encephalitis virus. The specificity and sensitivity of the individual analytes were examined by testing serially-diluted viral cultures, including DV-2, DV-4, JEV, TBE. The results showed no false-positive or-negative results. Chicken eggs inoculated with infected human serum were also used for validation of the ELISA-array assay. All samples showed high reaction signals with capture antibody 2B5, which was specific for TBEV. The ELISA-array assay suggested that the three patients were all infected with TBEV. To verify the results tested by ELISA-array, RNA extracted from chicken eggs was applied to a real time-RT-PCR assay using primers and probes targeting TBEV. The results were also positive."
3022,Children under 15 years old were excluded from the study.
303,"The detected fatality rate of H7N9 Avian flu was 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong). However, the real case fatality rate should be much lower than this due to the possibility of undetected mild or asymptomatic cases."
3033,Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM) is characterized by an acute and rapidly progressive encephalopathy including hemorrhagic necrosis of the parenchyma of the central nervous system. It is usually fatal. The salient findings in AHEM include fulminant encephalopathy with hemorrhagic necrosis and most often fatal outcome.

Additionally, a cavity was also seen visualized by HRCT."
3256,"According to the paper, the only patient who recovered from severe HAdV-55 infection had higher T-cell counts. Three of the five patients had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted. The results suggest that these three patients may have been relatively immunocompromised and that a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for HAdV-55 infection in young adults."
326,"Random Peptide Libraries (RPL) can be used in many applications including the identification of peptide ligands by receptors, the mapping of substrate sites for enzymes, and the creation of antibody peptide libraries. These applications are reviewed elsewhere [38, 46, 47]. RPLs can also be used to characterize the epitope of an antibody of interest through biopanning with a monoclonal antibody of interest, which can result in the isolation of mimotopes; these are oligopeptides that mimic the native antibody epitope. The selected recombinant inoviruses that carry mimotopes can then be isolated in order to determine the DNA and amino acid sequence of the displayed oligopeptides."
3270,HBoV1 was firstly identified in respiratory secretions of children with respiratory tract disease in 2005.
3465,The median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei were 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001.
3467,"The analysis showed that a considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that participants from outside Hubei province were associated with a lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan. Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress."

3593,"The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence is most similar to some bat beta-coronaviruses, with the highest being >96% identity."
3597,The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species (bats) are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution.
3600,The mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15) was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice.
3604,"Civets were proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans because the SARS-like CoV from civets shared 99.8% homology with the human SARS-CoV, with a total of 202 single-nucleotide (nt) variations (SNVs) identified across the genome."
3611,"The rumour that the virus was made by humans in the lab claimed that the SARS-CoV-2 was artificially, or intentionally, made by humans in the lab."

3625,"Based on current evidence, the pathogenicity for 2019-nCoV is about 3%, which is significantly lower than SARS-CoV (10%) and MERS-CoV (40%)."
3629,"The systematic search was conducted to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, therapeutic drugs, and vaccines for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The search focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and validation trials for diagnostic tests, therapeutic drugs, and vaccines published in English, that measured the sensitivity and/or specificity of a rapid diagnostic test or a point-of-care testing kit, the impact of drug therapy, or vaccine efficacy against either of these diseases. The search also included in vitro, animal, or human studies published in English between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020, on the same outcomes of interest for the 2019-nCoV."
3633,"The period and type of specimens collected play an important role in the diagnosis of viral infections such as 2019-nCoV. For example, respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are commonly used for RT-PCR testing, as they have higher viral loads and are more likely to yield positive results. In the early period of illness, patients may have high levels of virus despite mild symptoms, and respiratory specimens are more likely to be positive for the virus while serum may be negative. False negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection, transportation, or handling. Therefore, proper collection and handling of specimens are crucial for accurate diagnosis."
3636,"RT-iiPCR and a one-step rRT-PCR have shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for MERS-CoV compared to other diagnostic methods such as real-time RT-PCR and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). These methods are also rapid, simple, and convenient."
3642,"There are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally for the 2019-nCoV, and a wide range of technology is being applied, such as messenger RNA, DNA-based, nanoparticle, synthetic and modified virus-like particle. The vaccines in development include viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, virus-like particles (VLPs)-based vaccine, inactivated whole-virus (IWV) vaccine, and live attenuated vaccine."
3646,"The safety of vaccines is an important consideration in vaccine development. According to the paper, all vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS were reported to be safe, well-tolerated, and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. For example, a Phase I clinical trial on the MERS-CoV vaccine by GeneOne Life Science & Inovio Pharmaceuticals reported that the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. Another Phase I clinical trial on a SARS vaccine conducted by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases also reported positive results. However, it is important to note that these trials were conducted on a small number of participants and further studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of these vaccines."
3656,"During the SARS epidemic, many prospective and retrospective cohort studies were conducted on the usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin only. These studies investigated the efficacy of different treatments for SARS, including antibiotic usage, integrative Chinese and Western treatment, usage of a specific Chinese medicine, and early use of corticosteroid. Additionally, there was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir usage in 152 participants. However, there have yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating the usage of these treatments."
3659,"Rapid diagnostics facilitates prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention, and control measures. It enables the fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection, which can prevent or delay local transmission and clusters by isolating laboratory-confirmed cases and quarantining their close contacts. Rapid diagnostics also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination."
3669,"The existing practices in detecting genetic material of viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and nucleic amplification tests (NAAT). These methods can detect the genetic material of the virus through amplification and detection of specific viral nucleic acid sequences."

3690,"MALAT1 is a long non-coding RNA that is involved in multiple types of physiological processes, such as alternative splicing, nuclear organization, and epigenetic modulating of gene expression. It is over-expressed in many human oncogenic tissues and regulates cell cycle and survival. Additionally, MALAT1 is closely related to various pathological processes, including diabetes complications and cancers."
3700,"Some examples of coronaviruses that have emerged as important human pathogens include severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in 2002-2003 to cause a large-scale epidemic with about 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) which has caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012."
3701,"In both of these epidemics (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host (the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV) before crossing species barriers to infect humans."
3704,"SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of ∼ 10% and ∼ 35%, respectively. In contrast, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly."
3712,"For the prediction of protein secondary structures, including beta sheet, alpha helix, and coil, initial amino acid sequences were input and analyzed using neural networking and its own algorithm. Predicted structures were visualized and highlighted on the BOX-SHADE alignment. Structural analysis of orf8 was performed using PSI-blast-based secondary structure prediction (PSIPRED) algorithms."
3715,"The genome of 2019-nCoV has 82% nucleotide identity with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. The S2 subunit of the Spike glycoprotein structures were similar among the 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and the bat SARS-related ZC45."
3716,"The major distinction between SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV is in orf3b, Spike, and orf8, but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots."
3723,"Further investigation of the external subdomain of the soluble variable region of the Spike glycoprotein will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis."

3803,"On 27 January 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe asked countries to complete a WHO standard COVID-19 case report form for all confirmed and probable cases according to WHO criteria. The overall aim of surveillance at this time was to support the global strategy of containment of COVID-19 with rapid identification and follow-up of cases linked to affected countries in order to minimize onward transmission."
3807,"The WHO case definition adopted for surveillance is that a confirmed case is a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay."
3811,The paper does not provide information on the places linked to the duration of hospitalization.
3815,The duration of hospitalization was reported for 16 cases with a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days).
3819,"The asymptomatic cases were tested as part of screening using a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation. The specimen types tested were reported for 27 cases: 15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate, and one a positive endotracheal aspirate."
3821,Fever was reported as the sole symptom for nine cases.
3823,Data on pre-existing conditions were reported for seven cases.
3824,Five cases had no pre-existing conditions.
3835,The two contexts for transmission were sporadic cases among travelers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases).
3836,The analysis shows that the time from symptom onset to hospitalization/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases. This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany.
3837,"For locally acquired cases, significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine are required, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. Once the exposure is determined and contacts identified and quarantined, further cases are likely to be rapidly detected and isolated."
3840,The finding that fever was reported as the sole symptom for some cases prompted ECDC to include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.
3841,"Understanding the infection-severity is critical to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population. It can help identify the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic, estimate the incidence of severe cases, and identify virus spread and containment. This information is essential to contain the international spread of infection and to allocate public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population."
3843,"Hospital-based surveillance can help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death. It can also help monitor the intensity and limited completeness of disease transmission, trends, and its geographical spread."
3845,"The approach of using established hospital surveillance systems and sentinel primary care-based surveillance systems for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded to help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death of COVID-19. This approach will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity in areas with community transmission. Countries together with ECDC and WHO, should use all opportunities to address these questions in a coordinated fashion at the European and global level."
3848,"The paper discusses multiple recent discoveries, including the new bunyavirus SFTSV, new enteroviruses found in human feces, and new insect viruses identified in China."
3854,Respiratory virus infection is one of the major sources of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.
3858,"The authors have reviewed recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. They have also reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflammatory diseases and summarized how recent models have expanded our appreciation of the mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbations."
3859,"The paper discusses the mechanisms by which respiratory viral infections exacerbate chronic airway inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The paper highlights the importance of studying the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection. The paper also discusses the dysregulation of the immune response, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium induced by viral infections, leading to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Finally, the paper suggests that alternative measures targeting novel viral-induced acute exacerbation mechanisms, especially in the upper airway, can serve as supplementary treatments of the currently available management strategies to augment their efficacy."
3861,"This review consolidates the understanding of viral-induced exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases and indicates pathways that may be targeted for more effective management of chronic inflammatory diseases. The review focuses on compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease."
3864,"Treatment and management of chronic airway inflammatory diseases vary in efficacy due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, the effect of episodic exacerbations of the disease, which are due to the effect of enhanced acute airway inflammation impacting upon and worsening the symptoms of the existing disease, further complicates treatment and management."
3868,"The mechanisms of exacerbation may vary considerably in different individuals under various triggers due to the complex interactions between the host and the exacerbation agents. Acute exacerbations are usually due to the presence of environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, smoke, cold or dry air, and pathogenic microbes in the airway. These agents elicit an immune response leading to infiltration of activated immune cells that further release inflammatory mediators that cause acute symptoms such as increased mucus production, cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. The high diversity of the respiratory viruses may also contribute to exacerbations of different nature and severity."
3876,The lower airway is the site of dysregulated inflammation in most chronic airway inflammatory diseases.
3879,"The authors compiled recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. They highlighted the importance of the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection. The authors also indicated pathways that may be targeted for more effective management of chronic inflammatory diseases. They suggested that further studies in natural exacerbations and in viral-challenge models using RNA-sequencing or single-cell RNA-seq on a range of time-points may provide important information regarding viral pathogenesis and changes induced within the airway of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients to identify novel targets and pathway for improved management of the disease."
3884,"Other viruses that have been recently reported as contributing to acute exacerbations include bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), certain coronavirus (CoV) strains, a specific enterovirus (EV) strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV)."
3886,Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells.
3893,"This review will serve to provide further understanding of viral-induced exacerbation in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation, and improve the quality of life of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
3902,"The substitution E62D is considered a secondary substitution because, although it does not confer resistance by itself, when combined with a known resistance-associated substitution (RAS), it confers a higher level of resistance than the one achieved by the RAS alone in relapsers to LDV. However, it is sometimes regarded as a RAS, despite conferring only a 1.2 fold change in resistance in in vitro studies using the 1a replicon system."
3943,"Human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies."
3962,"Several factors can increase the severity of exacerbations in the airway, including the presence of environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, smoke, cold or dry air, and pathogenic microbes in the airway. Viral infections are also a major driver of exacerbations, accounting for up to 80-90% and 45-80% of exacerbations in children and adults, respectively. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. The change in the local airway environment and the release of cellular content into the airway due to massive cell death induced by viral infections may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes the growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome."
3963,"This is especially true when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance, in particular, the late onset of a bacterial infection."
3970,Individuals with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance.
3975,"These factors, such as MMPs and growth factors, induce epithelial remodeling during regeneration after viral infection. In addition, infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as influenza virus (IFV), usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
3976,"Human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies."
3982,"Respiratory viral infections can cause acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, leading to increased inflammation, worsening of symptoms, and prolonged exacerbation episodes. These infections can also cause disruption of tight junctions in the airway epithelium, leading to increased infiltration of viruses, allergens, and pathogenic bacteria, further worsening inflammation and altering the airway microbiome. Additionally, viral infections can induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alter the expression of microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs, leading to aberrant epithelial response and exacerbations."
3984,"The destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway, which may then prolong exacerbations or result in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors. In addition, the destruction of the epithelial barrier, mucociliary function, and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening of tight junctions further augments the inflammation and exacerbations."
3985,"Epithelial destruction may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or result in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors. Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as influenza virus (IFV), usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
3988,"Infection of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions, which increases the rate of viral infiltration and the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. This disruption of tight junctions may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils, worsening the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells, and during the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche. The inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms."
3989,"An example of this is the finding that viral infections such as RV and RSV weakly induce antiviral responses, which may result in an altered inflammatory state contributing to further viral persistence and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Additionally, viral infections can result in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium. These changes can further worsen the symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
3994,"Viral infection can alter the local airway environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. It can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier. Ciliary proteins associated with the mucociliary function can be destroyed by viral infections, leading to mucus overproduction and disruption of the equilibrium of the mucociliary function. Additionally, viral infections can alter the nutrient profile in the airway through the release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth. Furthermore, viral infections can result in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium. These changes can further worsen the symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
4001,"The destruction of the epithelial barrier, mucociliary function, and cell death of the epithelial cells in the airway can lead to increased contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. This can further augment inflammation and exacerbations. The opening of tight junctions increases the leakiness of the airway, further aggravating inflammation and exacerbations. Additionally, viral infections are usually accompanied by oxidative stress, which can further increase local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. The change in the local airway environment and the release of cellular content into the airway due to massive cell death induced by viral infections may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway."
4002,"Viral infections are usually accompanied by an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection. Infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFNα/β) and type III (IFNλ) interferons, cytokines, and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). These, in turn, enable infiltration of innate immune cells and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that will then release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12. These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells, and B-cells. The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases."
4007,"Infections such as RSV are shown to weakly induce antiviral responses, which may result in an altered inflammatory state contributing to further viral persistence and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening, which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils, worsening the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Both IFV and RSV infections have been shown to increase miR-21 and augmented inflammation in experimental murine asthma models, which is reversed with a combination treatment of anti-miR-21 and corticosteroids."
4012,"Viral infections, especially infections caused by respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), were linked to the exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Other viruses such as parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV), and adenovirus (AdV) have also been implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent."
4017,Non-coding RNAs present as targets to modulate viral-induced airway changes as a means of managing exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. They are involved in post-transcriptional modulation of biological processes and implicated in a number of diseases.
4018,"Other than miRNA modulation, epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation may also play a role in exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Recent epigenetic studies have indicated the association of epigenetic modification and chronic airway inflammatory diseases, and that the nasal methylome was shown to be a sensitive marker. Additionally, viral infections are usually accompanied by oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation."
4020,"These studies have shown that viral infections, including those caused by these viruses, can induce dysregulation of the immune response, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium, leading to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. They have also highlighted the importance of the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection."
4031,"The humanized mouse model that possesses human immune cells can be used to unravel the immune profile of a viral infection in healthy and diseased conditions. In addition, epithelial cell models such as the air-liquid interface, in vitro airway epithelial model that has been adapted to studying viral infection, can be used to analyze functions. Further studies in natural exacerbations and in viral-challenge models using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or single-cell RNA-seq on a range of time-points may provide important information regarding viral pathogenesis and changes induced within the airway of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients to identify novel targets and pathways for improved management of the disease."
4039,"The study found important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B, and coronavirus only during summer, whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. Influenza A not H1N1 virus had a first wave in June, and a second wave of ILI consultations with mainly identification of Parainfluenza viruses and not influenza viruses was observed in 2011. In 2012, the second epidemic wave at the end of austral winter coincided with Influenza viruses and Rhinovirus circulation."

4069,"The overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3% within HMPV-A and 80% within HMPV-B. The length of the F-M2 intergenic region was different between group A and B viruses, that is, 13 nt and 2 nt, respectively. The SH protein length was variable between group A and B strains due to a nucleotide substitution (CAA ➔ TAA) at gene position 532 in group B, resulting in protein lengths of 178 and 180 aa, respectively. The predicted G protein length also varied among the different HMPV subgroups, between 219 and 241 aa, due to different positions of the Stop codon."

5177,Tissue resident alveolar macrophages follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung.
5179,Reduced TNFα production by NK cells was identified as a crucial upstream mechanism of depressed antimicrobial activities by alveolar macrophages.
518,"There is no single best method to identify pneumonia in a person. Chest radiologic changes have been considered the gold standard for defining a pneumonia event, but clinical findings can also be used. Indications for chest radiography include hospitalization, severe hypoxemia or respiratory distress, failed initial antibiotic therapy, or suspicion for other diseases (tuberculosis, inhaled foreign body) in reporting chest radiographs. However, point-of-care lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising modality for diagnosing childhood pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia should be made based on a combination of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings."

5214,"The conclusion of this study is that mixed respiratory infections and IP-10 may play major, interconnected roles in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. The study also suggests that miRNA-200a-3p may play a role in the regulation of IP-10 expression. However, the study acknowledges several limitations and suggests that a larger, longitudinal study will be necessary to confirm these results."
5217,"According to the passage, H5N1 subtype influenza virus is a worldwide threat to public health due to its rapid spread and high pathogenicity. The virus can be transmitted directly from poultry to humans and cause acute respiratory infections. The symptoms in animals or humans infected with H5N1 include fever, encephalitis, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The World Health Organization reported 622 human cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection, including 371 deaths (a mortality rate >50%), from 2003 to 2013. Therefore, the high mortality rate and the potential for rapid spread make H5N1 a significant threat to public health worldwide."
5224,"This study demonstrates that intranasal administration of Eupatorium adenophorum polysaccharides (EAP) prior to H5N1 viral challenge improves survival rates of infected mice with a corresponding reduction of pulmonary viral load. The anti-H5N1 effect was very likely due to the innate immune recognition of EAP and the secretion of innate immune mediators (IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-) before infection. Furthermore, the effect of EAP on PRR expression (including TLR2, TLR4, Dectin-1, and MR) was determined both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that the innate immune recognition of EAP was dependent upon the activation of the Dectin-1 and MR pathways. Therefore, EAP may have immunomodulatory properties and a potential prophylactic effect against H5N1 influenza infection. This study offers an alternative strategy for the development of novel anti-influenza agents and benefits the utilization of E. adenophorum products."
5225,"According to the passage, treatment of EAP shortly after infection or 24 hours post-infection did not provide a survival advantage. The excessive inflammation induced by H5N1 virus leads to severe respiratory symptoms and host immune injury, and the use of anti-inflammatory agents may provide a survival advantage. However, in this case, receiving an immunomodulator alone cannot help the animal to survive. This likely explains why immunomodulator treatment prior to viral infection results in a better survival rate."
523,The reported H1N1 vaccination rate in China in 2009 was 10.8%.
5231,"The marmoset is an appropriate animal model for pathogen research because of its small size, immune response to infection that is comparable to humans, and the ability to house more statistically relevant numbers within high containment.

524,"The revised WHO definition of ""presumed bacterial pneumonia"" has been shown to have greater sensitivity than the original WHO radiologic definition of primary end-point pneumonia for detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. Using the revised definition, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-10) had a vaccine efficacy of 22% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in young children in South America, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination-13 had a vaccine efficacy of 39% in preventing presumed bacterial pneumonia in children older than 16 weeks who were not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was associated with a 26% decrease in radiologic pneumonia in California between 1995 and 1998. However, it is important to note that the revised definition does not distinguish bacterial from viral etiology, and many children with clinical pneumonia could actually have viral bronchiolitis, for which antibiotics are not beneficial."

The developed microbial platform is a robust, versatile, and efficient microbial cell factory for the glycosylation of small molecules. The proposed strategy can be used to produce virtually any glycoside, and the obtained productivities are the highest reported to date and compete with current production processes. However, further improvement can be limited due to solubility issues of the aglycon or of the glycoside."

590,The Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) method is a modeling approach that utilizes regression trees and boosting algorithms to fit several models and combines them for improving prediction by performing iterative loop throughout the model. BRT is a 'space' oriented approach that accounts for the effects of physical proximity. The advantage of BRT is that it applies stochastic processes that include probabilistic components to improve predictive performance. BRT has been widely used for species distribution modeling and has been applied in numerous studies for predicting the distribution of HPAI H5N1 disease.

They naturally exist in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), including Peyer's patches (PPs), isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and scatter throughout the subepithelial lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine and colon. DCs play a crucial role in the maintenance of gut homeostasis and are essential for the initiation and regulation of immune responses."
645,"Caring for COVID-19 patients represents a substantial exposure risk for ICU staff due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, high exposure dose, long daily contact hours, and ICU stay. The basic reproductive number of COVID-19 was estimated to be 2.2, which means that each infected person can transmit the virus to an average of 2.2 people. The virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, contact, and fecal-oral routes, and even transmission through the eye is possible. The higher viral load and aerosol-generating procedures, such as noninvasive ventilation, magnify the exposure and transmission risk. Therefore, healthcare providers and those in contact with infected patients should utilize contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with N95 respirator. Strict infection prevention and control practices have been implemented and audited in hospitals following the infection prevention and control plan published by China's National Health Committee (CNHC)."
658,"Both CQ and HCQ are weak bases that are known to elevate the pH of acidic intracellular organelles, such as endosomes/lysosomes, essential for membrane fusion. In addition, CQ could inhibit SARS-CoV entry through changing the glycosylation of ACE2 receptor and spike protein. Time-of-addition experiment confirmed that HCQ effectively inhibited the entry step, as well as the postentry stages of SARS-CoV-2, which was also found upon CQ treatment. To further explore the detailed mechanism of action of CQ and HCQ in inhibiting virus entry, co-localization of virions with early endosomes (EEs) or endolysosomes (ELs) was analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) and confocal microscopy. Quantification analysis showed that, at 90 min p.i. in untreated cells, 16.2% of internalized virions (anti-NP, red) were observed in early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1)-positive EEs (green), while more virions (34.3%) were transported into the late endosomal-lysosomal."

For long-time predictions, more complicated mathematical models such as the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model may be necessary, but these models require more effort for unknown parameters identification."
798,"One factor to consider when using common vectors for the delivery of vaccines is pre-existing immunity in the host. For example, a common viral vector such as Ad often has pre-existing immune responses in the host, which has the potential to modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen. This can be a problem as it may reduce the efficacy of the vaccine. Therefore, it is important to consider the host's pre-existing immunity to the vector when selecting a vector for vaccine delivery."
799,"A way to measure virus transmission is to estimate the reproduction number (Rt), which is a fundamental epidemiological quantity representing the average number of infections, at time t, per infected case over the course of their infection. If Rt is maintained at less than 1, the incidence of new infections decreases, ultimately resulting in control of the epidemic. If Rt is greater than 1, then infections will increase (dependent on how much greater than 1 the reproduction number is) until the epidemic peaks and eventually declines due to acquisition of herd immunity."
805,E. coli is a commensal and lactic acid bacteria are present in most fermented food items and are therefore naturally present in the host. They are also a much safer option than traditional attenuated vaccines in children and immunecompromised people.
806,"A slowing growth in daily reported deaths can be caused by the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, quarantine, and closure of public places. These interventions can reduce the transmission of the virus and, as a result, slow down the growth of the epidemic. The slowing growth in daily reported deaths is indicative of a slowing in the growth of the epidemic."
823,"China's interventions introduced in January, including strict movement restrictions, case isolation, and quarantine, achieved a downward trend in the number of confirmed new cases during February, resulting in zero new confirmed indigenous cases in Wuhan by March 19th. Studies have estimated that the reproduction number (Rt) changed during this time in different areas of China from around 2-4 during the uncontrolled epidemic down to below 1, indicating that the interventions were effective in reducing the transmission of the virus."
836,"Adenovirus (Ad) has several advantages as a vaccine delivery vector. It is one of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens, due to ease of production, safety profile, genetic stability, the ease of DNA genome manipulation, and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses. Ad vectors have been extensively examined as a delivery vector in several preclinical and clinical studies for infectious diseases such as anthrax, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza, measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), malaria, and tuberculosis. Ad vectors are also relatively easy to produce in large quantities, making them a practical choice for vaccine development."
837,"An alternative way to estimate the course of an epidemic is to back-calculate infections from observed deaths. This method involves estimating the number of infections that led to the observed deaths, assuming a certain infection fatality ratio and time lag between infection and death. Reported deaths are likely to be more reliable than reported cases, although the early focus of most surveillance systems on cases with reported travel histories to China may mean that some early deaths will have been missed. This method can provide a systematically unbiased view of trends, unlike case data, which gives a systematically biased view of trends."

857,United Kingdom's estimated mean percentage [95% credible interval] of total population infected as of 28th March is 2.7% [1.2%-5.4%].
862,"There is high uncertainty in estimating the impact of interventions against the coronavirus because many interventions have occurred only recently, and their effects have not yet been fully observed due to the time lag between infection and death. Additionally, different trends may be in place in different parts of each country, and the epidemic in northern Italy was subject to succession. Furthermore, there are not enough data to estimate the individual effect size of each intervention, and it is statistically impossible to determine which intervention had the greatest effect due to the close spacing of interventions in time. Finally, estimating reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 presents challenges due to the high proportion of infections not detected by health systems and regular changes in testing policies, resulting in different proportions of infections being detected over time and between countries."
870,"An example of the effect of immunity to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination is the use of Ad serotype 5 (AdHu5)-based HIV-1 vaccine. In a large-scale clinical trial (STEP), the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5. This is because the presence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen."
876,"The effect of the host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination is complex and can vary depending on the type of vector used. For bacterial-delivered antigens, the humoral responses were influenced by pre-existing immunity, with slightly more studies finding augmentation rather than diminution. However, in the case of viral vectors, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. This might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen."
879,"For viral vectors, the impact of cell-mediated immunity is more pronounced, and it almost always results in a reduction in the subsequent immune response. This is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses, this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes."
881,"According to the paper, 2019-nCoV may be transmitted through multiple routes, including respiratory, fecal-oral, or body fluid routes.

It is poorly defined in the context of CNS development and function, but recent evidence from genetic characterization of human patients suggests that haploinsufficiency of KATNAL1 is linked with a number of symptoms including intellectual disability (ID) and craniofacial dysmorphologies."
932,"Mutations in the KATNAL1 gene are associated with a range of behavioral and neuronal disturbances, including changes in circadian rhythms, sleep, anxiety, learning/memory, neuronal migration, neuronal morphology, and ependymal ciliary function. These mutations can lead to a number of behavioral changes, including in learning and memory, reaction to anxiogenic situations, and circadian rhythms. The downstream effect of these defects leads in turn to a number of behavioral changes including in learning and memory, reaction to anxiogenic situations and circadian rhythms."
