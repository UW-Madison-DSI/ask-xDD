However, the current leading modeling framework for evaluating contact tracing is highly stylized, lacking important features and heterogeneities present in real-world contact patterns that are relevant for epidemic dynamics. Here, we fill this gap by considering a modeling framework extensively informed by real-world, high-resolution contact data to analyze the impact of digital (app-based) containment strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate a spread in realistic scenarios such as a university campus, a workplace, or a high school. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in confining the epidemics but come at the cost of quarantining a large part of the population with a consequent social cost. It is possible to design less limiting policies, considering at risk only contacts with longer exposure and at shorter distance, in order to avoid this effect. Our results also show that isolation and tracing alone are unlikely to be sufficient to keep an outbreak under control, and additional measures need to be implemented simultaneously. Moreover, we confirm that a high level of app adoption is crucial to make digital contact tracing an effective measure. Finally, given the currently implemented infectiousness, we find that strategies focusing on long exposure times, even for weak links, perform better than approaches that emphasize close-range contacts for shorter time-periods. Our results have implications for the app-based contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.</p>']\n\nV0 retrieve API:\n['A simple way to present contact data is to use matrices where the elements represent the rate of contact between subgroups such as age groups represented by the columns and rows.

Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~50%. Slight increases in masking relative to current levels would reduce the reproductive number substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks that reduce transmission risk by 50% will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who do get infected, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy is only effective for this indication as post-exposure prophylaxis, specifically if given to ~50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure.

In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups other than Native Americans.

The general strategy for wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2 is to sample the influent of wastewater treatment plants or upstream for identifying local sources when WWTPS catchments are large, extract total RNA from a known volume of influent sample, and then estimate SARS-CoV-2 gene copy numbers per mL of the sample using reverse transcriptomics coupled with reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Ahmed et al., 2020). However, very few studies have examined other wastewater matrices for SARS-CoV-2, including primary clarifier solids, mixed liquor bacterial activated biomass, and anaerobically digested biosolids, otherwise known as \u201csludges or biosolids\u201d (Kocamemi et al., 2020). In a typical wastewater treatment employing an activated sludge process, the incoming raw influent passes through preliminary treatment units such as course screens and grit chambers before passing on to the primary clarifiers. After that, the treated wastewater typically flows through a bioreactor. After a specific hydraulic retention time, the mixture of treated wastewater and mixed liquor sludge is taken to a gravity settler where most of the suspended biosolids settle down (Metcalf and Eddy, 2014). By nature of these settling processes, particles tend to partition into solids and settle down as well. In one study, nearly 26% of viruses examined were adsorbed to the solids portion of wastewater (Ye et al., 2016).']\n\n", "gpt_eval": ["XDD API", "Hybrid API"]}, {"question": "How COVID wastewater viral RNA concentration can predict infectious rate", "raw_eval": "Question: How COVID wastewater viral RNA concentration can predict infectious rate\n\nXDD API (article level, showing abstract only):\n['<p>BACKGROUND: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) provides an opportunity for near real-time, cost-effective monitoring of community level transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

We used Cox regression to estimate the time varying effects of primary and booster vaccination and previous infection on the risks of omicron infection, hospitalization, and death.\\n\\nResults: For children 5 to 11 years of age, the effectiveness of primary vaccination against infection was 59.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58.5 to 61.2), 33.7% (95% CI, 32.6 to 34.8), and 14.9% (95% CI, 12.3 to 17.5) at 1, 4 and 10 months after the first dose; the effectiveness of a monovalent or bivalent booster dose after 1 month was 24.4% (95% CI, 14.4 to 33.2) or 76.7% (95% CI, 45.7 to 90.0); and the effectiveness of omicron infection against reinfection was 79.9% (95% CI, 78.8 to 80.9) and 53.9% (95% CI, 52.3 to 55.5) after 3 and 6 months, respectively.

Bivalent boosters were more effective than monovalent boosters.

To monitor New York City (NYC) for the presence of novel variants, we amplified regions of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein gene from RNA acquired from all 14 NYC wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and ascertained the diversity of lineages from these samples using high throughput sequencing. Here we report the detection and increasing frequencies of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages not recognized in GISAIDs EpiCoV database. These lineages contain mutations rarely observed in clinical samples, including Q493K, Q498Y, H519N and T572N. Many of these mutations were found to expand the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by allowing infection of cells expressing the human, mouse, or rat ACE2 receptor. In addition, pseudoviruses containing the Spike amino acid sequence of these lineages were found to be resistant to many different classes of receptor binding domain (RBD) binding neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. We offer several hypotheses for the anomalous presence of these mutations, including the possibility of a non-human animal reservoir.

This dilution effect in the up\\xad stream sewer system suggests a low sensitivity of the method when sampling is applied only to the WWTP or to larger geographical areas, especially when the morbidity is low and/or highly localized.
