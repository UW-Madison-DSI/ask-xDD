In addition, the loss of the protective components of saliva can result in a rapid, marked increase in caries. Where discontinuing medication or substituting less harmful agents is not possible, a protective regimen for the oral environment should be instituted.

      "Given the marked differences in composition among the parotid, submandibular, sublingual and minor gland secretions, and the pronounced effects of flow rate on the concentration of many constituents [Mandel, 1980], meaningful data can only be generated when separately collected secretions are examined at a known flow rate. We do have such data, mostly from the parotid, thanks to the two normative aging studies. In the Boston study [Chauncey, etal., 1981], sodium, chloride, calcium, total protein and uric acid levels decreased significantly with age. In contrast, the urea level increased in older age groups. The authors noted that, despite the maintenance of a normal flow rate, there was evidence of alterations in glandular electrolyte transport mechanisms, reflection of alterations in renal function (elevated urea), and a modest general reduction in protein synthesis.\n",
      "The findings from the Baltimore study are only partially in agreement. Baum, et al. [1983] also noted differences in the handling of sodium. Although they did not measure chloride, it is probable that this decrement would have also been noted in the older subjects since these electrolytes are usually paired. In both studies, potassium was found to be \n",

      "Saliva is one of our natural resources. As with most natural resources we do not fully appreciate the bounty until there is an acute shortage. The critical importance of saHva in the protection of the oral cavity becomes most apparent when malfunctions of the salivary glands (due to disease, pharmacologic agents or thereapeutic intervention) result in dry mouth or xerostomia. The mucosa becomes dry, rough, sticky, bleeds readily and is subject to ulceration and infection [Rauch, 1970]. The tongue becomes red, smooth, shmy, hypersensitive and loses taste acuity [Henkin, et al., 1972]. Unless oral hygiene is meticulous, the teeth become covered with loosely adherent and tightly adherent plaque; caries progresses rapidly and extensively. These conditions may exacerbate periodontitis. In the edentulous patient, dentures become extremely difficult to manage with poor retention, sore spots and ulceration. The incidence of Candida infection increases. Patients with xerostomia have difficulty eating, speaking and even sleeping; they may feel miserable.\n",

Lipid research should be pursued vigorously both in the secretions and in vitro employing various salivary gland and salivary gland cell model systems [Kuyatt & Baum, 1981]; Baum, et al., 1983]. These systems have been employed to study carbohydrates and proteins and they can be adapted to the study of lipids as well.\n",
      "We have no data on the effects of aging on the nonimmunological systems of saliva, and only preliminary data on secretory IgA [Papas, et al., 1981], either total levels or specific antibodies. Functional studies on bacterial adherence and bacterial aggregation, as well as the determinants of bacterial clearance would be as important as the quantification of specific components. Salivary protection is dependent on the interaction of a spectrum of molecules and systems, and much research is needed to sort out the details.\n",

      "The major changes in composition associated with xerostomia are a marked increase in total protein and in calcium, probably protein-bound [Mandel, unpublished observations]. These changes result in a thick, viscous secretion and add to the discomfiture of the patient. Electrolyte concentration is normal when the reduced flow rate is taken into consideration, since glandular function per se is normal [Mandel, 1980]. The problem is the pharmacologically mediated interference with neural control and/or blood flow.\n",

      "In recent years we have come to appreciate that saliva is a complex fluid containing a variety of systems that serve a broad spectrum of physiologic needs. It even caters to our epicurean pleasures. The salivary contribution to ingestion and digestion is largely preparative and gastronomic; it forms a mucin-coated food bolus and adequate fluid volume to allow for ready passage along the chewing and swallowing surfaces and the provision of an appropriate environment for optimal functioning of the taste buds. Although this is the role of saliva only during meal time, we have come to embrace the view (perhaps conditioned by Pavlov's experiments) that it was the major function of saliva. For most of the day and night, however, the salivary glands are not responding to gustatory and masticatory stimuli but are providing a basal fluid that helps to maintain the integrity of the teeth, tongue and mucous membranes of the oral \n",

      "In studies at Columbia [Stuchell, et al., 1983], all patients with primary SS have been found to have virtually no salivary flow in the absence of stimulation, that is at rest. About 60% have a markedly reduced flow even with strong gustatory stimulation; while 40% have an essentially normal flow with stimulation. Both groups, however, exhibit the same abnormalities in salivary chemistry (elevated sodium, chloride, IgA, IgG and lactoferrin and a decreased concentration of phosphate). In view of the variation in flow rate in patients with SS, chemical quantification of selected salivary components can be a valuable aid in the differential diagnosis of this disease and in monitoring patients over time. Elevation in beta2microglobulin in both saliva and serum is also a diagnostic aid [Michalske & Daniels, 1975], in both secondary and primary SS.\n",
