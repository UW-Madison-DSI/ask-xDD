A complete summary of the clinical outcomes of this clinical trial has not yet been published. A study protocol for a Phase I/II clinical trial using continuous intratumoral infusion of LSFV-IL12 in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme patients has been described, but no data are available on the status of this clinical trial [18].\\nVenezuelan equine encephalitis vectors Development of VEEV VRP for human clinical evaluation has occurred in both an infectious disease and cancer setting [20–23].

Recruitment of children and toddlers for clinical evaluation of SeV (as a vaccine against hPIV-1) in these age groups is occurring now [223]. Supported by the clinical safety demonstrated by wild-type SeV it has become the focus of vaccine vector development.\\nGarcin et al. (1995) were the first to rescue infectious SeV from cDNA using vaccinia T7 expressing helper virus and plasmids providing the NP, P and L genes along with the SeV genome as described above [138]. This was followed closely by another group in 1996 [145]. In addition to replicationcompetent SeV vectors, versions modified by deletion of the F gene have been developed that are not transmissible [224]. The SeV-DF vector must be produced in cells that provide F in trans to make particles. These particles are able to infect cells in a similar manner to replication-competent SeV [225,226] and express heterologous genes but cannot spread to other cells [224,225]. Initial recombinant SeV viruses expressed reporter genes, but researchers rapidly began to introduce a host of additional genes [226,227]. Although SeV has been used to develop vaccines against a large range of pathogens (see TABLE',\n",
