Model for forecasting Covid cases and hospitalizations
Covid model with infections and hospitalization
COVID model that  support NPIs that effect a change in baseline transmission levels, including support for interventions implemented at different points in time, and for various lengths of time, which may depend on the values of output variables (hospitalizations in particular). The model should allow the user to choose the specific start date of the intervention, and length of time in place, etc., or set triggers for intervention start and end times.
